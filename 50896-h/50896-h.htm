    <h2>
      A HUMBLE ABOLITIONIST
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>ndrew Duncan and
      his wife trudged along the unshaded road in the beating sunshine, and
      paused to rest under the gnarled white-trunked sycamore trees. She wore a
      drooping gown of checked homespun, a sun-bonnet of the same material, the
      hood of which was stiffened with invisible strips of cardboard, and a pair
      of coarse shoes just from the shop. Her husband was barefooted, his shirt
      was soiled, and he wore no coat to hide the fact. His trousers were worn
      to shreds about the ankles, but their knees were patched with new cloth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never was as thirsty in all my born days,&rdquo; he panted, as he looked down
      into the bluish depths of a road-side spring. &ldquo;Gee-whilikins! ain&rsquo;t it
      hot?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An&rsquo; some fool or other&rsquo;s run off with the drinkin&rsquo;-gourd,&rdquo; chimed in his
      wife. &ldquo;Now ain&rsquo;t that jest our luck?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We &rsquo;ll have to lap it up dog-fashion, I reckon,&rdquo; Andrew replied,
      ruefully, &ldquo;an&rsquo; this is the hardest spring to git down to I ever seed. Hold
      on, Ann; I &rsquo;ll fix you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke he knelt on the moss by the spring, turned his broad-brimmed
      felt hat outside in, and tightly folded it in the shape of a big dipper.
      He filled it with water, and still kneeling, held it up to his wife. When
      their thirst was satisfied, they turned off from the road into a path
      leading up a gradual slope, on the top of which stood a three-roomed log
      cabin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are waitin&rsquo; fer us,&rdquo; remarked Duncan. &ldquo;I see &rsquo;em out in the passage.
      My Lord, I wonder what under the sun they &rsquo;ll do with Big Joe. Ever&rsquo; time
      I think of the whole business I mighty nigh bu&rsquo;st with laughin&rsquo;.&rdquo; Mrs.
      Duncan smiled under her bonnet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s powerful funny myself,&rdquo; she said, as she followed after him,
      her new shoes creaking and crunching on the gravel. To this observation
      Duncan made no response, for they were now in front of the cabin.
    </p>
    <p>
      An old man and an old woman sat in the passage, fanning their faces with
      turkey-wing fans. They were Peter Gill and his wife, Lucretia.
    </p>
    <p>
      The latter rose from her chair, which had been tilted back against the
      wall, and with clattering heels, shambled into the room on the right.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon you&rsquo;d ruther set out heer whar you kin ketch a breath o&rsquo; air
      from what little&rsquo;s afloat,&rdquo; she said, cordially, as she emerged, a chair
      in either hand. Placing the chairs against the wall opposite her husband,
      she took a pair of turkey-wings from a nail on the wall and handed them to
      her guests, and with a grunt of relief resumed her seat. For a moment no
      one spoke, but Duncan presently broke the silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I went an&rsquo; seed Colonel Whitney fer you,&rdquo; he began, his blue eyes
      twinkling with inward amusement. &ldquo;An&rsquo;, Pete Gill, I&rsquo;m powerfully afeerd
      you are in fer it. As much as you&rsquo;ve spoke agin slave-holdin&rsquo; as a
      practice, you&rsquo;ve got to make a start at it. The Colonel said that you held
      a mortgage on Big Joe, an&rsquo; ef you don&rsquo;t take &rsquo;im right off you won&rsquo;t get a
      red cent fer yore debt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m prepared fer it,&rdquo; burst from Mrs. Gill. &ldquo;I tried my level best to
      keep Mr. Gill from lendin&rsquo; the money, but nothin&rsquo; I could say would have
      the least influence on &lsquo;im. The Lord only knows what we &rsquo;ll do. We are
      purty-lookin&rsquo; folks to own a high-priced, stuck-up quality nigger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two visitors exchanged covert glances of amusement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did you manage to git caught?&rdquo; Andrew asked, crushing a subtle smile
      out of his face with his broad red hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter Gill had grown quite red in the face and down his wrinkled, muscular
      neck. As he took off his brogans to cool his feet, and began to scratch
      his toes through his woolen socks, it was evident to his questioner that
      he was not only embarrassed but angry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The thousand dollars was all the money we was ever able to save up,&rdquo; he
      said. &ldquo;I was laying off to buy the fust piece o&rsquo; good land that was on the
      market, so me &rsquo;n the ol&rsquo; &rsquo;oman would have a support in old age. But I
      didn&rsquo;t see no suitable farm just then, an&rsquo; as my money was lyin&rsquo; idle in
      the bank, Lawyer Martin advised me to put it out at intrust, an&rsquo; I kinder
      tuck to the notion. Then Colonel Whitney got wind o&rsquo; the matter an&rsquo; rid
      over an&rsquo; said, to accommodate me, he&rsquo;d take the loan. He fust give me a
      mortgage on some swampy land over in Murray, that Martin said was wuth ten
      thousand, an&rsquo; it run on that way fur two yeer. The fust hint I had of the
      plight I was in was when the Colonel couldn&rsquo;t pay the intrust. Then I went
      to another lawyer, fer it looked like Martin an&rsquo; the Colonel was kinder in
      cahoot, an&rsquo; my man diskivered that the lan&rsquo; had been sold long before it
      was mortgaged to me for taxes. My lawyer wasn&rsquo;t no fool, so he got Whitney
      in fer a game o&rsquo; open-an&rsquo;-shut swindle. He up an&rsquo; notified &rsquo;im that ef my
      claim wasn&rsquo;t put in good shape in double-quick time, he was goin&rsquo; to put
      the clamps on somebody. Well, the final upshot was that I tuck Big Joe as
      security, an&rsquo; now that the Colonel&rsquo;s entire estate has gone to flinders,
      I&rsquo;ve got the nigger an&rsquo; my money&rsquo;s gone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Duncan waited for the speaker to resume, but the aspect of the case was so
      disheartening that Gill declined to say more about it. He simply hitched
      one of his heels up on the last rung of his chair and began to fan himself
      vigorously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did as you wanted me to,&rdquo; said Duncan, wiping his brow and combing his
      long, damp hair with his fingers. &ldquo;I went round an&rsquo; axed the opinion o&rsquo;
      several good citizens, an&rsquo; it is the general belief ef you don&rsquo;t take the
      nigger you won&rsquo;t never git back a cent o&rsquo; yore loan. But the funniest part
      o&rsquo; the business is the way Big Joe acts about it.&rdquo; Dun can met his wife&rsquo;s
      glance and laughed out impulsively. &ldquo;You see, Gill, in the Whitney
      break-up, all the other niggers has been sold to rich families, an&rsquo; the
      truth is, Big Joe feels his dignity tuck down a good many pegs by bein&rsquo;
      put off on you-uns, that never owned a slave to yore name. The other
      darkies has been a-teasin&rsquo; of &rsquo;im all day, an&rsquo; he&rsquo;s sick an&rsquo; tired of it.
      The Whitneys has spiled &rsquo;im bad. They l&rsquo;arnt &rsquo;im to read an&rsquo; always let
      &rsquo;im stan&rsquo; dressed up in his long coat in the big front hall to invite
      quality folks in the house. They say he had his eye on a yaller gal, an&rsquo;
      that he&rsquo;s been obliged to give her up, fer she&rsquo;s gone with one of the
      Staffords in Fannin&rsquo; County.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gill&rsquo;s knee, which was thrust out in front of him by the sharp bend of his
      leg, was quivering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Big Joe might do a sight wuss &rsquo;n to belong to me,&rdquo; he said, warmly. &ldquo;I
      don&rsquo;t know as we-uns &rsquo;ll have any big hall for &rsquo;im to cavort about in, nur
      anybody any wuss &rsquo;n yore sort to come to see us, but we pay our debts an&rsquo;
      have a plenty t&rsquo;eat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gill was listening to this ebullition, her red nose slightly
      elevated, and she made no effort to suppress a chuckle of satisfaction
      over her husband&rsquo;s subtle allusion to the status of their guests.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want you two jest to come heer one minute,&rdquo; she burst out suddenly, and
      with a dignity that seemed to cool the air about her, she rose and moved
      toward the little shed room at the end of the cabin. Duncan and his wife
      followed, an expression of half-fearful curiosity in their tawny visages.
      Reaching the door of the room, Mrs. Gill pushed it open and coolly
      signaled them to enter, and when they had done so, and stood mutely
      looking about them, she followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I made up my mind we&rsquo;d be obliged to take Big Joe,&rdquo; she explained,
      &ldquo;I fixed up fer &rsquo;im a little. Look at that bedstead!&rdquo; (Her hand was
      extended toward it as steadily as the limb of an oak.) &ldquo;Ann Duncan, you
      are at liberty to try to find a better one in this neighborhood. You &lsquo;n
      Andrew sleep on one made out &rsquo;n poles with the bark on &lsquo;em. Then jest feel
      o&rsquo; them thar feathers in this new tick an&rsquo; pillows, an&rsquo; them&rsquo;s bran-new
      store-bought sheets.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This second open allusion to her own poverty had a subduing effect on Mrs.
      Duncan&rsquo;s risibilities. The ever-present twinkle of amusement went out of
      her eyes, and she had an attitude of vast consideration for the words of
      her hostess as she put her perspiring hand on the mattress and pressed it
      tentatively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s saft a plenty fer a king,&rdquo; she observed, conciliation enough for any
      one in her tone; &ldquo;he &rsquo;ll never complain, I bound you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Big Joe won&rsquo;t have to tech his bare feet to the floor while he&rsquo;s puttin&rsquo;
      on his clothes, nuther,&rdquo; reminded Mrs. Gill. She raised her eyebrows as an
      admiral might after seeing a well-directed shot from one of his guns blow
      up a ship, and pointed at a piece of rag carpet laid at the side of the
      bed. &ldquo;An&rsquo; you see I&rsquo;ve fixed &rsquo;im a washstand with a new pan thar in the
      corner, an&rsquo; a roller towel, an&rsquo; bein&rsquo; as they say he&rsquo;s so fixy, I&rsquo;m
      a-goin&rsquo; to fetch in the lookin&rsquo;-glass, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ve cut some pictur&rsquo;s out &lsquo;n
      newspapers that I intend to paste up on the walls, so as&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gill paused. Experienced as she was in the tricks of Ann Duncan&rsquo;s
      facial expression, she at once divined that her words were meeting with
      amused opposition.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Mis&rsquo; Gill,&rdquo; was Ann&rsquo;s rebuff, &ldquo;shorely you ain&rsquo;t a-goin&rsquo; to let &lsquo;im
      sleep in the same house with you-uns!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I am, Ann Duncan; what in the name o&rsquo; common sense do you
      mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, nuthin&rsquo;.&rdquo; Mrs. Duncan glanced at her husband and wiped a cowardly
      smile from her broad mouth with her hand. &ldquo;You see, Mis&rsquo; Gill, I&rsquo;m afeerd
      you are goin&rsquo; to overdo it. You&rsquo;ve heerd me say I have good stock in me,
      ef I am poor. I&rsquo;ve got own second cousins that don&rsquo;t know the&rsquo;r own slaves
      when they meet &rsquo;em in the big road. I&rsquo;ve heerd how they treat their
      niggers, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;m afeerd all this extra fixin&rsquo; up will make folks poke fun
      at you. To-day in town the niggers started the laugh on Big Joe
      theirselves, an&rsquo; the white folks all j&rsquo;ined in. It looked like they
      thought it was a good joke for the Gill lay-out to own a quality slave. Me
      &rsquo;n Andrew don&rsquo;t mean no harm, but now it <i>is</i> funny; you know it is!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see a thing that&rsquo;s the least bit funny in it.&rdquo; Mrs. Gill bristled
      and turned almost white in helpless fury. &ldquo;We never set ourselves up as
      wantin&rsquo; to own slaves, but when this one is saddled on us through no fault
      o&rsquo; our &lsquo;n, I see no harm in our holdin&rsquo; onto &rsquo;im till we kin see our way
      out without loss. As to &rsquo;im not sleepin&rsquo; in the same cabin we do, whar in
      the Lord&rsquo;s creation would we put &lsquo;im? The corn-crib is the only thing with
      a roof on it, an&rsquo; it&rsquo;s full to the door.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I reckon you are doin&rsquo; the best you kin,&rdquo; granted Mrs. Duncan, as she
      passed out of the door and went back to where Peter Gill sat fanning
      himself. He had overheard part of the conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told Lucretia she oughtn&rsquo;t to fix up so almighty much,&rdquo; he observed. &ldquo;A
      nigger ain&rsquo;t like no other livin&rsquo; cre&rsquo;ture. A pore man jest cayn&rsquo;t please
      &lsquo;em.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ann Duncan was driven to the very verge of laughter again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What you goin&rsquo; to call &lsquo;im?&rdquo; she snickered, her strong effort at keeping
      a serious face bringing tears into her eyes. &ldquo;Are you goin&rsquo; to make &lsquo;im
      say Marse Gill, an&rsquo; Mis&rsquo; Lucretia?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care a picayune what he calls us,&rdquo; answered Gill, testily. &ldquo;I
      reckon we won&rsquo;t start a new language on his account.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Through this colloquy Mrs. Duncan had been holding her sun-bonnet in a
      tight roll in her hands. She now unfurled it like the flag of a switchman
      and whisked it on her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I wish you luck with yore slave,&rdquo; she was heard to say, crisply,
      &ldquo;but I hope you &rsquo;ll not think me meddlin&rsquo; ef I say that you &rsquo;ll have
      trouble. Folks like you-uns, an&rsquo; we-uns fer that matter, don&rsquo;t know no
      more about managin&rsquo; slaves raised by high-falutin&rsquo; white folks than
      doodle-bugs does.&rdquo; And having risen to that climax, Ann Duncan, followed
      by her splay-footed, admiring husband, departed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning, accompanied by Big Joe and the man who had been overseer
      on his plantation, Colonel Whitney drove over in a spring wagon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I decided to bring Joe over myself, so as to have no misunderstanding,&rdquo;
       he announced. &ldquo;The other negroes have been picking at him a good deal, and
      he is a little out of sorts, but he &rsquo;ll get all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Gills were standing in the passage, a look of stupid embarrassment on
      their honest faces. Despite their rugged strength of character, they were
      not a little awed by the presence of such a prominent member of the
      aristocracy, notwithstanding the fact that their dealings with the Colonel
      had not, in a financial way, been just to their fancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m much obliged to you, sir,&rdquo; Peter found himself able to enunciate.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Colonel lighted a cigar and began to smoke. A sad, careworn expression
      lay in his big blue eyes. He had the appearance of a man who had not slept
      for a week. His tired glance swept from the Gills to the negro in the
      wagon, and he said, huskily:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bounce out, Joe, and do the very best you can. I hate to part with you,
      but you know my condition&mdash;we&rsquo;ve talked that over enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Slowly the tall black man crawled out at the end of the wagon and stood
      alone on the ground. The expression of his face was at once so full of
      despair and fiendishness that Mrs. Gill shuddered and looked away from
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Gill,&rdquo; said the planter, &ldquo;I reckon me and you are even at last. I&rsquo;m
      going down to Savannah, where I hope to get a fresh start and amount to
      more in the world. Goodbye to you&mdash;good-bye, Joe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had only nodded to the pair in the passage, but he reached over the
      wagon-wheel for the hand of the negro, and as he took it a tender
      expression of regret stamped itself on his strong features.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be a good boy, Joe,&rdquo; he half-whispered. &ldquo;As God is my heavenly judge, I
      hate this more than anything else in the world. If I could possibly raise
      the money I&rsquo;d take you with me&mdash;or free you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The thick, stubborn lip of the slave relaxed and fell to quivering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye, Marse Whit&rsquo;,&rdquo; he said, simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Colonel took a firmer grasp of the black hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No ill-will, Joe?&rdquo; he questioned, anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, suh, Marse Whit&rsquo;, I hain&rsquo;t got no hard feelin&rsquo;s &rsquo;gin you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then good-bye, Joe. If I ever get my head above water, I &rsquo;ll keep
      my promise about you and Liza. She looked on you as her favorite, but
      don&rsquo;t raise your hopes too high. I&rsquo;m an old man now, and it may be uphill
      work down there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The negro lowered his head and the overseer drove on. As the wagon rumbled
      down the rocky slope a wisp of blue smoke from the Colonel&rsquo;s cigar
      followed it like a banner unfurled to the breeze. For several minutes
      after the wagon had disappeared Big Joe stood where he had alighted, his
      eyes upon the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; asked Gill, stepping down to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothin&rsquo;, Marse&mdash;&rdquo; Big Joe seemed to bite into the word as it rose to
      his tongue, then he shrugged his shoulders contemptuously and looked down
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Gills exchanged ominous glaces, and there was a pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you had anything to eat this morning?&rdquo; Gill bethought himself to
      ask.
    </p>
    <p>
      The black man shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t teched a bite sence dey sol&rsquo; me; dey offered it to me, but I
      didn&rsquo;t want it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Once more the glances of the husband and wife traveled slowly back and
      forth, centering finally on the face of the negro.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon it&rsquo;s &lsquo;cause yore sick at heart,&rdquo; observed Gill, at first
      sympathetically, and then with growing firmness as he continued. &ldquo;I know
      how you feel; most o&rsquo; yore sort has a way o&rsquo; thinkin&rsquo; yorese&rsquo;ves a sight
      better &rsquo;n pore white folks, an&rsquo; right now the truth is you can&rsquo;t bear the
      idee o&rsquo; belongin&rsquo; to me &rsquo;n my wife. Now, me &rsquo;n you an&rsquo; her ought to come
      to some sort of agreement that we kin all live under. You won&rsquo;t find
      nuther one of us the overbearin&rsquo; sort. We was forced to take you to secure
      ourse&rsquo;ves agin the loss of our little all, an&rsquo; we want to do what&rsquo;s fair
      in every respect. I&rsquo;m told you are a fust-rate shoemaker. Now, ef you want
      to, you kin set up a shop in yore room thar, an&rsquo; have the last cent you
      kin make. You &rsquo;ll git plenty o&rsquo; work, too, fer this neighborhood is badly
      in need of a shoemaker. Now, my wife will fry you some fresh eggs an&rsquo;
      bacon an&rsquo; make you a good cup o&rsquo; coffee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But all that Peter Gill had managed to say with satisfaction to himself
      seemed to have gone into one of the negro&rsquo;s ears and to have met with not
      the slightest obstruction on its way out at the other. To the hospitable
      invitation which closed Peter&rsquo;s speech, the negro simply said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t feel like eatin&rsquo; a bite.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Gill, at the end of his resources; &ldquo;maybe you&rsquo;d feel
      different about it ef you was to smell the bacon a-fryin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wan&rsquo;t to eat,&rdquo; reiterated the slave. &ldquo;Well, you needn&rsquo;t unless
      you want to,&rdquo; went on Gill, still pacifically. &ldquo;That thar room on the
      right is fer you; jest go in it whenever you feel like it an&rsquo; try to make
      yorese&rsquo;f at home; you won&rsquo;t find us hard to git along with.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Gills left their human property seated on a big rock in front of the
      cabin and withdrew to the rear. There they sat till near noon. Now and
      then Gill would peer around the corner to satisfy himself that his slave
      was still seated on the rock. Gill chewed nearly a week&rsquo;s allowance of
      tobacco that morning; it seemed to have a sedative effect on his nerves.
      Finally, Ann Duncan loomed up in the distance and strode toward the cabin.
      She wore a gown of less brilliant tints than the one she had worn the day
      before. It had the dun color of clay washed into rather than out of its
      texture, and it hung from her narrow hips as if it were damp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he <i>did</i> come,&rdquo; she remarked, introductively.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gill nodded. &ldquo;Yes; the Colonel fetched &rsquo;im over this mornin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I heerd, an&rsquo; I jest &lsquo;lowed I&rsquo;d step over an&rsquo; see how you made out.&rdquo;
       Mrs. Duncan&rsquo;s rippling laugh recalled the whole of her allusions of the
      day previous. &ldquo;Thar&rsquo;s more talk goin&rsquo; round than you could shake a stick
      at, an&rsquo; considerable spite an&rsquo; envy. Some &lsquo;lows that the havin&rsquo; o&rsquo; this
      slave is agoin&rsquo; to make you stuck up, an&rsquo; that you &rsquo;ll move yore
      membership to Big Bethel meetin&rsquo;-house; but law me! I can see that you are
      bothered. How did he take to his room?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He ain&rsquo;t so much as looked in yit,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Gill, with a frown.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon Ann Duncan ventured up into the passage and peered cautiously
      round the corner at Big Joe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;sa-wipin&rsquo; of his eyes,&rdquo; she announced, as she came back. &ldquo;It looks
      like he&rsquo;s a-cryin&rsquo; about some &lsquo;n&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this juncture, a motley cluster of men, women, and children, led by
      Andrew Duncan, came out of the woods which fringed the red, freshly plowed
      field below, and began to steer itself, like a school of fish, toward the
      cabin. About fifty yards away they halted, as animals do when they scent
      danger. Heads up and open-mouthed, they stood gazing, first at the Gills,
      and then at their slave. Peter Gill grew angry. He stood up and strode as
      far in their direction as the ash-hopper under the apple-tree, and raised
      both his hands, as if he were frightening away a flock of crows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be off, the last one of you!&rdquo; he shouted; &ldquo;and don&rsquo;t you dare show
      yorese&rsquo;ves round heer unless you&rsquo;ve got business. This ain&rsquo;t no side-show&mdash;I
      want you to understand that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They might have defied their old neighbor Gill, but the owner of a slave
      so big and well dressed as the human monument on the rock was too
      important a personage to displease with impunity; so, followed by the
      apologetic Mrs. Duncan, who blamed herself for having set a bad example to
      her curious neighbors, they slowly dispersed.
    </p>
    <p>
      At noon Mrs. Gill went into the cabin and began to prepare dinner. She
      came back to her husband in a moment, and in a low voice, and one that
      held much significance, she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I need some firewood.&rdquo; As she spoke she allowed her glance to rest on Big
      Joe. Gill looked at the sullen negro for half a minute, and then he
      shrugged his shoulders as if indecision were a burden to be shaken off,
      and mumbling something inaudible he went out to the woodpile and brought
      in an armful of fuel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A pore beginning,&rdquo; his wife said, as he put it down on the hearth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it,&rdquo; retorted Gill, angrily. &ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t begin that sort o&rsquo; talk,
      fer I won&rsquo;t stand it. I&rsquo;m a-doin&rsquo; all I can.&rdquo; And Gill went back to his
      chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      The good housewife fried some slices of dark red ham. She boiled a pot of
      sweet potatoes, peeled off their jackets, and made a pulp of them in a
      pan; into the mass she stirred sweet milk, butter, eggs, sugar, and grated
      nutmeg. Then she rolled out a sheet of dough and cut out some open-top
      pies.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never knowed a nigger that could keep his teeth out of &lsquo;em,&rdquo; she
      chuckled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half an hour later she called out to Gill to come in. He paused in the
      doorway, staring in astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I never!&rdquo; he ejaculated.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had laid the best white cloth, got out her new knives and forks with
      the bone handles, and some dishes that were never used except on rare
      occasions. She had placed Gill&rsquo;s plate at the head of the table, hers at
      the foot, and was wiping a third&mdash;the company plate with the blue
      decorations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whar&rsquo;s he goin&rsquo; to set an&rsquo; eat?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blast me ef I know any more &rsquo;n a rat,&rdquo; Gill told her, with alarmed
      frankness. &ldquo;I hain&rsquo;t thought about it a bit, but it never will do fer &lsquo;im
      to set down with me an&rsquo; you. Folks might see it, an&rsquo; it would give &lsquo;em
      more room for fun.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gill laid the plate down and sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I declare, I&rsquo;m afeered this nigger is a-goin&rsquo; to stick us up, whether or
      no. I won&rsquo;t feel much Christian humility with him at one table an&rsquo; us at
      another, but of course I know it ain&rsquo;t common fer folks to eat with their
      slaves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gill&rsquo;s glance was sweeping the table and its tempting dishes with an
      indescribable air of disapproval.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a-fixin&rsquo;up powerful,&rdquo; was his slow comment; &ldquo;a body would think,
      to look at all this, that it was the fourth Sunday an&rsquo; you was expectin&rsquo;
      the preacher. You&rsquo;d better begin right; we cayn&rsquo;t keep this up an&rsquo; make a
      crop.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes flashed angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had no business to bring Big Joe heer, then,&rdquo; she fumed. &ldquo;You know
      well enough he&rsquo;s used to fine doin&rsquo;s, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;m not a-goin&rsquo; to have &rsquo;im make
      light of us, ef we <i>are</i> pore. I was jest a-thinkin&rsquo;; the Whitneys
      always tied napkins &lsquo;round the&rsquo;r necks to ketch the gravy they drap, an&rsquo;
      Big Joe&rsquo;s bound to notice that we ain&rsquo;t used to sech.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was finally agreed that for that day at least the slave was to have his
      dinner served to him where he sat; so Mrs. Gill arranged it temptingly on
      a piece of plank, over which a piece of cloth had been spread, and took it
      out to him. She found him almost asleep, but he opened his eyes as she
      drew near.
    </p>
    <p>
      Drowsily he surveyed the contents of the cups and dishes, his eyes
      kindling at the sight of the two whole custards. But his pride&mdash;it
      was evidently that&mdash;enabled him to manifest a sneer of
      irreconcilability.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t a-goin&rsquo; t&rsquo;eat a bite,&rdquo; was the way he put it, stubbornly.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment Mrs. Gill was nonplussed; but she believed in getting at the
      core of things.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you a-complainin&rsquo;?&rdquo; she questioned.
    </p>
    <p>
      The big negro&rsquo;s sneer grew more pronounced, but that was all the answer he
      gave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think you could stomach a bit o&rsquo; this heer custard pie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Big Joe&rsquo;s eyes gleamed against his will, but he shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tol&rsquo; um all ef dey sol&rsquo; me to you, I wouldn&rsquo;t eat a bite. I&rsquo;m gwine ter
      starve ter death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s yore intention!&rdquo; Mrs. Gill caught her breath. A sort of
      superstitious terror seized upon her as she slowly hitched back to the
      cabin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He won&rsquo;t tech a bite,&rdquo; she informed Gill&rsquo;s expectant visage; &ldquo;an&rsquo; what&rsquo;s
      a sight more, he says he&rsquo;s vowed he won&rsquo;t eat our victuals, an&rsquo; that he&rsquo;s
      laid out to starve. Peter Gill, I&rsquo;m afeerd this has been sent on us!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sent on us!&rdquo; echoed Gill, who also had his quota of superstition.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s a visitation of the Almighty fer our hoardin&rsquo; up that money
      when so many of our neighbors is in need. I wish now we never had seed it.
      Ef Big Joe dies on our hands, I &rsquo;ll always feel like we have committed the
      unpardonable sin. We&rsquo;ve talked ag&rsquo;in&rsquo; slave-holdin&rsquo; all our lives tell we
      had the bag to hold, an&rsquo; now we&rsquo;ve set up reg&rsquo;lar in the business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gill ate his dinner on the new cloth in morose silence. A heavy air of
      general discontent had settled on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he commented, as he went to the water-shelf in the passage to take
      his afterdinner drink from the old cedar pail, &ldquo;ef he refused &lsquo;tater
      custards like them thar he certainly is in a bad plight. If he persists, I
      &rsquo;ll have to send fer a doctor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The afternoon passed slowly. The later conduct of the slave was
      uneventful, beyond the fact that he rose to his full height once,
      stretched and yawned, without looking toward the cabin, and then reclined
      at full length on the grass. Another batch of curious neighbors came as
      near the cabin as the spring. Those who had been ordered away in the
      forenoon had set afloat a report that Gill had said that, now he was a
      slave-holder, he would not submit to familiar visits from the poor white
      trash of the community. And Sid Ruford, the ringleader of the group at the
      spring, had the boldness to shout out some hints about the one-nigger,
      log-cabin aristocracy which drove the hot blood to Gill&rsquo;s tanned face. He
      sprang up and took down his long-barreled &ldquo;squirrel gun&rdquo; from its hooks on
      the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I &rsquo;ll jest step down thar,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;an&rsquo; see ef that gab is meant fer
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t pay no &lsquo;tention to him,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Gill, who was held back
      from the brink of an explosion only by the sight of the weapon and a
      knowledge of Gill&rsquo;s marksmanship. However, Gill had scarcely taken half a
      dozen steps down the path when he wheeled and came back laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They run like a passle o&rsquo; skeerd sheep,&rdquo; he chuckled, as he restored his
      gun to its place.
    </p>
    <p>
      This incident seemed to break the barrier of reserve between him and his
      human property, for he stood over the prostrate form of the negro and eyed
      him with a dissatisfied look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See heer,&rdquo; he began, sullenly, &ldquo;enough of a thing is a plenty. I&rsquo;m
      gettin&rsquo; sick an&rsquo; tired o&rsquo; this, an&rsquo; I &rsquo;ll be dadblasted ef I&rsquo;m a-goin&rsquo; to
      let a black, poutin&rsquo; scamp make me lose my nat&rsquo;ral sleep an&rsquo; peace o&rsquo;
      mind. Now, you git right up off &rsquo;n that damp ground an&rsquo; go in yore room
      an&rsquo; lie down, if you feel that-a-way. Folks is a-passin&rsquo; along an&rsquo; lookin&rsquo;
      at you like you was a stuffed monkey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It may have been the sight of the gun, or it may have been a masterful
      quality in the Anglo-Saxon voice, that inspired the negro with a respect
      he had not hitherto entertained for his new owner, for he rose at once and
      went into his room.
    </p>
    <p>
      At dusk Mrs. Gill waddled to the closed door of his apartment and rapped
      respectfully. She heard the bed creaking as if Big Joe were rising, and
      then he cautiously opened the door and with downcast eyes waited for her
      to make her wishes known.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Supper is ready,&rdquo; she announced, in a voice which, despite her strength
      of character, quivered a little, &ldquo;an&rsquo; before settin&rsquo; down to it, I thought
      thar would be no harm in askin&rsquo; if thar&rsquo;s anything that would strike yore
      fancy. When it gits a little darker I could blind a chicken on the roost
      an&rsquo; fry it, or I could make you some thick flour soup with sliced
      dumplin&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She saw him wince as he tore himself from the temptation she had laid
      before him, but he spoke quite firmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t a-goin&rsquo; t&rsquo;eat any more in this worl&rsquo;,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I reckon you won&rsquo;t gorge yorese&rsquo;f in the next,&rdquo; said Mrs. Gill,
      &ldquo;but I want to say that what you are contemplatin&rsquo; is a sin.&rdquo; She turned
      back into the cabin and sat at the table and poured her husband&rsquo;s coffee
      in disturbed silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe on my soul he&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to make a die of it,&rdquo; she said, after a
      while, as she sat munching a piece of dry bread, having no appetite at
      all. And Gill, deeply troubled, could make no reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was their habit to go to bed as soon as supper was over, so when they
      rose from the table Mrs. Gill turned down the covers of the high-posted
      bed and beat the pillows. Before barring the cabin door, she scrutinized
      the closed shutter directly opposite, but all was still as death in the
      room of the slave.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the first night in many years the old pair found they could not sleep,
      their brains being still active with the first great problem of their
      lives. The little clock struck ten. The silence of the night was disturbed
      by the shrilling of tree-frogs and the occasional cry of the
      whip-poor-will.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly Gill sprang up with a little grunt of alarm. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; he
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It sounded powerful like somebody a-groanin&rsquo;,&rdquo; whispered Mrs. Gill. &ldquo;Oh,
      Lordy, Peter, I have a awful feelin&rsquo;!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I &rsquo;ll git up an&rsquo; see what&rsquo;s ailin&rsquo; &lsquo;im,&rdquo; said Gill, a little more calmly.
      &ldquo;Mebby the idiot has done without food till he&rsquo;s took cramps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dressing himself hastily, he went outside. A pencil of yellow light was
      streaming through a crack beneath Big Joe&rsquo;s door. Gill had not put on his
      shoes, and his feet fell softly on the grass. Putting his ear to the door
      of the negro&rsquo;s room, he overheard low groans and words which sounded like
      a prayer, repeated over and over in a sing-song fashion. Later he heard
      something like the sobbing of a bigchested man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Open up!&rdquo; cried Gill, shaking the door; &ldquo;open up, I say!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The vocal demonstration within ceased, and there was a clatter in the
      vicinity of the bed, as if Big Joe were rising to his feet, The farmer
      repeated his firm command, and the shutter slowly opened. The negro looked
      like a giant in the dim light of the tallow-dip on a table behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was that you a-makin&rsquo; all that noise?&rdquo; asked Gill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wus prayin&rsquo;, suh,&rdquo; answered Big Joe, his face in the shadow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that was it; I didn&rsquo;t know!&rdquo; Gill was trying to master a most
      irritating awkwardness on his part; in questions of religious ceremony he
      always allowed for individual taste. Passing the negro, he went into the
      cabin and lifted the tallow-dip above his head and looked about the room
      suspiciously. &ldquo;You was jest a-prayin&rsquo;, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, suh; I was a-prayin&rsquo; to de Gre&rsquo;t Marster ter tek me off on a bed o&rsquo;
      ease, sence I hatter go anyway. Er death er starvation ain&rsquo;t no easy job.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gill sat down on the negro&rsquo;s bed. He crossed his legs and swung a bare
      foot to and fro in a nervous, jerky manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Looky&rsquo; heer,&rdquo; he said finally to the black profile in the doorway, &ldquo;you
      are a plagued mystery to me. What in the name o&rsquo; all possessed do you
      hanker after a box in the cold ground fer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The slave seemed slightly taken aback by the blunt directness of this
      query; he left the door and sat down heavily in a chair at the fireplace.
      &ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; he grunted, &ldquo;is you been all dis time en not fin&rsquo; out what my
      trouble is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ef I <i>did</i> know I wouldn&rsquo;t be settin&rsquo; heer at this time o&rsquo; night,
      losin&rsquo; my nat&rsquo;ral sleep to ask about it,&rdquo; was the tart reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      The negro grunted again. &ldquo;Do you know Marse Whit&rsquo;s Liza?&rdquo; he asked, almost
      eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe I&rsquo;ve seed &rsquo;er once or twice,&rdquo; Gill told him. &ldquo;A fine-lookin&rsquo;
      wench&mdash;about the color of a sorghum ginger-cake. Is she the one you
      mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The big man nodded. &ldquo;Me &rsquo;n her was gwine ter git married, but Marse Whit&rsquo;
      hatter go &rsquo;n trade &rsquo;er off ter Marse Stafford, en Marse Stafford is done
      give &rsquo;er &rsquo;er freedom yistiddy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, he set &rsquo;er free, did he?&rdquo; Gill stared, and by habit awkwardly stroked
      that part of his face where a beard used to grow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, suh; Marse Gill, he done set &rsquo;er free, en now a free nigger is
      flyin&rsquo; roun&rsquo; her. She won&rsquo;t marry no slave now, suh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gill drew a full breath and stood up. &ldquo;Then it wasn&rsquo;t becase you thought
      yorese&rsquo;f so much better &rsquo;n me &rsquo;n my wife that you wanted to dump yorese&rsquo;f
      into eternity?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, suh; dat wasn&rsquo;t in my min&rsquo;, suh.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m powerful glad o&rsquo; that, Joe,&rdquo; responded Gill, &ldquo;becase neither me
      nor my wife ever harmed a kink in yore head. Now, the gospel truth is, I
      was drawed into this whole business ag&rsquo;in&rsquo; my wishes, an&rsquo; me an&rsquo; Lucretia
      would give a lots to be well out of it. Now, I don&rsquo;t want to be the cause
      o&rsquo; that free nigger walkin&rsquo; off with yore intrusts, so heer&rsquo;s what I &lsquo;ll
      do. Ef you &rsquo;ll ride in town with me in the mornin&rsquo; I &rsquo;ll git a lawyer to
      draw up as clean a set o&rsquo; freedom papers as you ever laid your peepers on.
      What do you say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Big Joe&rsquo;s eyes expanded until they seemed all white, with dark holes in
      the center. For a minute he sat like a statue, as silent as the wall
      behind him; then he said, with a deep breath: &ldquo;Marse Gill, is you in
      earnest&mdash;my Gawd! <i>is</i> you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As the Almighty is my judge, in whose presence I set at this minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The negro covered his face with a pair of big, quivering hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Den I don&rsquo;t know what ter say, Marse Gill. I never expected to be a free
      man, en I had give up hope er ever seein&rsquo; Liza ag&rsquo;in. Oh, Marse Gill, you
      sho&rsquo; is one er His chosen flock!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gill was so deeply moved that when he ventured on a reply he found
      difficulty in steadying his speech. His voice had a quality that was new
      to it. He spoke as gently as if he were promising recovery to a suffering
      child.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Joe, you crawl back in bed an&rsquo; sleep,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;an&rsquo; in the mornin&rsquo;
      you &rsquo;ll be free, as shore as the sun rises on us both.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he went back to bed and told his wife what he had done.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m powerful glad we can git out of it so easy,&rdquo; she commented. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
      funny I never thought o&rsquo; settin&rsquo; &rsquo;im free. It looked to me like he was
      a-goin&rsquo; to be a burden that we never could git rid of, an&rsquo; now it&rsquo;s
      a-goin&rsquo; to end all right in the Lord&rsquo;s sight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were just dozing off in peaceable slumber when they heard a gentle
      rap on the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s me, Marse Gill,&rdquo; came from the outside. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m mighty sorry to wake
      you ag&rsquo;in, but I&rsquo;m so hungry I don&rsquo;t think I kin wait till mornin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I reckon you do feel kinder empty,&rdquo; laughed the farmer as he sprang
      out of bed. He lighted a candle, and following the specter-like signals of
      his wife, who sat up in bed, he soon found the meal she had arranged for
      the slave at noon. &ldquo;Thar,&rdquo; he said, as he handed it through the doorway;
      &ldquo;I had clean forgot yore fast was over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The next morning the farmer and Big Joe drove to town, two miles distant.
      Gill was gone all day and did not return till dusk. His wife went out to
      meet him at the wagon-shed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did you make out?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tip-top,&rdquo; he said, with a laugh. &ldquo;As we went to town, nothin&rsquo; would do
      the black scamp but we must go by after the gal. She happened to be
      dressed up, an&rsquo; went to town with us. I set in front an&rsquo; driv&rsquo;, while they
      done their courtin&rsquo; on the back seat. I soon got the papers in shape, an&rsquo;
      Squire Ridley spliced &rsquo;em right on the sidewalk in front o&rsquo; his office. A
      big crowd was thar, an&rsquo; you never heerd the like o&rsquo; yellin&rsquo;. Some o&rsquo; the
      boys, jest fer pure devilment, picked me up an&rsquo; carried me on their
      shoulders to the tavern an&rsquo; made me set down to a hearty dinner. Joe
      borrowed a apron from the cook an&rsquo; insisted on waitin&rsquo; on me, La me, I
      wisht you&rsquo;d &lsquo;a&rsquo; been thar. I felt like a blamed fool.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon you did have a lots o&rsquo; fun,&rdquo; said Mrs. Gill. &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m glad he
      ain&rsquo;t on our hands. I wouldn&rsquo;t pass another day like yis-tiddy fer all the
      slaves in Georgia.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      THE WHIPPING OF UNCLE HENRY
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span> do believe,&rdquo; said
      Mrs. Pelham, stooping to look through the oblong window of the
      milk-and-butter cellar toward the great barn across the farmyard, &ldquo;I do
      believe Cobb an&rsquo; Uncle Henry are fussin&rsquo; ag&rsquo;in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shorely not,&rdquo; answered her old-maid sister, Miss Molly Meyers. She left
      her butter bowl and paddles, and bent her angular figure beside Mrs.
      Pelham, to see the white man and the black man who were gesticulating in
      each other&rsquo;s faces under the low wagon-shed that leaned against the barn.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old women strained their ears to overhear what was said, but the stiff
      breeze from across the white-and-brown fields of cotton stretching toward
      the west bore the angry words away. Mrs. Pelham turned and drew the white
      cloths over her milkpans.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cobb will never manage them niggers in the world,&rdquo; she sighed. &ldquo;Henry has
      had Old Nick in &rsquo;im as big as a house ever since Mr. Pelham went off an&rsquo;
      left Cobb in charge. Uncle Henry hain&rsquo;t minded one word Cobb has said, nur
      he won&rsquo;t. The whole crop is goin&rsquo; to rack an&rsquo; ruin. Thar&rsquo;s jest one thing
      to be done. Mr. Pelham has jest got to come home an&rsquo; whip Henry. Nobody
      else could do it, an&rsquo; he never will behave till it&rsquo;s done. Cobb tried to
      whip &rsquo;im t&rsquo;other day when you was over the mountain, but Henry laid hold
      of a ax helve an&rsquo; jest dared Cobb to tech &lsquo;im. That ended it. Cobb was
      afeard of &lsquo;im. Moreover, he&rsquo;s afeard Uncle Henry will put p&rsquo;ison in his
      victuals, or do &rsquo;im or his family some bodily damage on the sly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be a powerful pity,&rdquo; returned Miss Molly, &ldquo;fer Mr. Pelham to
      have to lay down his business in North Carolina, whar he&rsquo;s got so awful
      much to do, an&rsquo; ride all that three hundred miles jest fer to whip one
      nigger. It looks like some other way mought be thought of. Couldn&rsquo;t you
      use your influence&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve talked till I&rsquo;m tired out,&rdquo; Mrs. Pelham interrupted. &ldquo;Uncle Henry
      promises an&rsquo; forms good resolutions, it seems like, but the very minute
      Cobb wants &rsquo;im to do some &rsquo;n a little different from Mr. Pelham&rsquo;s way,
      Henry won&rsquo;t stir a peg. He jest hates the ground Cobb walks on. Well, I
      reckon Cobb ain&rsquo;t much of a man. He never would work a lick, an&rsquo; if he
      couldn&rsquo;t git a job overseein&rsquo; somebody&rsquo;s niggers he&rsquo;d let his family
      starve to death. Nobody kin hate a lazy, good-for-nothin&rsquo; white man like a
      nigger kin. Thar Cobb comes now, to complain to me, I reckon,&rdquo; added Mrs.
      Pelham, going back to the window. &ldquo;An&rsquo; bless your soul, Henry has took his
      seat out in the sun on the wagon-tongue, as big as life. I reckon the
      whole crop will go to rack an&rsquo; ruin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The next moment a tall, thin-visaged man with gray hair and beard stood in
      the cellar door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m jest about to the end o&rsquo; my tether, Sister Pelham.&rdquo; (He always called
      her &ldquo;Sister,&rdquo; because they were members of the same church.) &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t get
      that black rascal to stir a step. I ordered Alf an&rsquo; Jake to hold &lsquo;im, so I
      could give &rsquo;im a sound lashin&rsquo;, but they was afeard to tech &lsquo;im.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Pelham looked at him over her glasses as she wiped her damp hands on
      her apron.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know how to manage niggers, Brother Cobb; I didn&rsquo;t much &lsquo;low
      you did the day Mr. Pelham left you in charge. The fust mornin&rsquo;, you went
      to the field with that hosswhip in your hand, an&rsquo; you&rsquo;ve toted it about
      ever since. You mought know that would give offense. Mr. Pelham never
      toted one, an&rsquo; yore doin&rsquo; of it looks like you &lsquo;lowed you&rsquo;d have a use fer
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I acknowledge I don&rsquo;t know what to do,&rdquo; said Cobb, frowning down her
      reference to his whip. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been paid fer three months&rsquo; work in advance,
      in the white mare an&rsquo; colt Mr. Pelham give me, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ve done sold &rsquo;em an&rsquo;
      used the money. I&rsquo;m free to confess that Brother Pelham&rsquo;s intrusts are
      bein&rsquo; badly protected as things are goin&rsquo;; but I&rsquo;ve done my best.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon you have,&rdquo; answered Mrs. Pelham, with some scorn in her tone. &ldquo;I
      reckon you have, accordin&rsquo; to your ability an&rsquo; judgment, an&rsquo; we can&rsquo;t
      afford to lose your services after you&rsquo;ve been paid. Thar is jest one
      thing left to do, an&rsquo; that is fer Mr. Pelham to come home an&rsquo; whip Henry.
      He&rsquo;s sowin&rsquo; discord an&rsquo; rebellion, an&rsquo; needs a good, sound lashin&rsquo;. The
      sooner it&rsquo;s done the better. Nobody can do it but Mr. Pelham, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;m
      goin&rsquo; in now an&rsquo; write the letter an&rsquo; send it off. In the mean time, you&rsquo;d
      better go on to work with the others, an&rsquo; leave Henry alone till his
      master comes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Brother Pelham is the only man alive that could whip &lsquo;im,&rdquo; replied Cobb;
      &ldquo;but it looks like a great pity an&rsquo; expense for Brother Pel&mdash;&rdquo; But
      the planter&rsquo;s wife had passed him and gone up the steps into the
      sitting-room. Cobb walked across the barnyard without looking at the
      stalwart negro sitting on the wagon-tongue. He threw his whip down at the
      barn, and he and half a dozen negroes went to the hayfields over the knoll
      toward the creek.
    </p>
    <p>
      In half an hour Mrs. Pelham, wearing her gingham bonnet, came out to where
      Uncle Henry still sat sulking in the sun. As she approached him, she
      pushed back her bonnet till her gray hair and glasses showed beneath it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Henry,&rdquo; she said, sternly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve jest done a thing that I hated mightily
      to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that, Mis&rsquo; Liza?&rdquo; He looked up as he asked the question, and then
      hung his head shamefacedly. He was about forty-five years of age. For one
      of his race he had a strong, intelligent face. Indeed, he possessed far
      more intelligence than the average negro. He was considered the most
      influential slave on any of the half-dozen plantations lying along that
      side of the river. He had learned to read, and by listening to the
      conversation of white people had (if he had acquired the colloquial speech
      of the middle-class whites) dropped almost every trace of the dialect
      current among his people. And on this he prided himself no little. He
      often led in prayer at the colored meeting-house on an adjoining
      plantation, and some of his prayers were more widely quoted and discussed
      than many of the sermons preached in the same church.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have wrote to yore master, Henry,&rdquo; answered Mrs. Pelham, &ldquo;an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ve tol&rsquo;
      &rsquo;im all yore doin&rsquo;s, an&rsquo; tol&rsquo; him to come home an&rsquo; whip you fer disobeyin&rsquo;
      Brother Cobb. I hated to do it, as I&rsquo;ve jest said; but I couldn&rsquo;t see no
      other way out of the difficulty. Don&rsquo;t you think you deserve a whippin&rsquo;,
      Uncle Henry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, Mis&rsquo; Liza.&rdquo; He did not look up from the grass over which he
      swung his rag-covered leg and gaping brogan. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know myself, Mis&rsquo;
      Liza. I want to help Marse Jasper out all I can while he is off, but it
      seems like I jest can&rsquo;t work fer that man. Huh, overseer! I say overseer!
      Why, Mis&rsquo; Liza, he ain&rsquo;t as good as a nigger! Thar ain&rsquo;t no pore white
      trash in all this valley country as low down as all his lay-out. He ain&rsquo;t
      fittin&rsquo; fer a overseer of nothin&rsquo;. He don&rsquo;t do anything like master did,
      nohow. He&rsquo;s too lazy to git in out of a rain. He&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will do, Henry. Mr. Pelham put him over you, an&rsquo; you&rsquo;ve disobeyed.
      He &rsquo;ll be home in a few days, an&rsquo; you an&rsquo; him can settle it between you.
      He will surely give you a good whippin&rsquo; when he gits here. Are you goin&rsquo;
      to sit thar without layin&rsquo; yore hand to a thing till he comes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, you know me better &rsquo;n that, Mis&rsquo; Liza. I&rsquo;ve done said I won&rsquo;t mind
      that man, an&rsquo; I reckon I won&rsquo;t; but the meadow-piece has obliged to be
      broke an&rsquo; sowed in wheat. I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to do that jest as soon as the
      blacksmith fetches my bull-tongue plow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Pelham turned away silently. She had heard some talk of the
      government buying the negroes from their owners and setting them free. She
      ardently hoped this would be done, for she was sure they could then be
      hired cheaper than they could be owned and provided for. She disliked to
      see a negro whipped; but occasionally she could see no other way to make
      them do their duty.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the dairy window, a few minutes later, she saw Uncle Henry put the
      gear on a mule, and, with a heavy plow-stock on his shoulder, start for
      the wheat-field beyond the meadow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He &rsquo;ll do two men&rsquo;s work over thar, jest to show what he kin do when he&rsquo;s
      let alone,&rdquo; she said to Miss Molly. &ldquo;I hate to see &rsquo;im whipped. He&rsquo;s too
      old an&rsquo; sensible in most things, an&rsquo; it would jest break Lucinda&rsquo;s heart.
      Mr. Pelham had ruther cut off his right arm, too; but he &rsquo;ll do it, an&rsquo; do
      it good, after havin&rsquo; to come so far.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pelham was a week in reaching the plantation. He wrote that it would
      take several days to arrange his affairs so that he could leave. He
      admitted that there was nothing left to do except to whip Uncle Henry
      soundly, and that they were right in thinking that Henry would not let any
      one do it but himself. After the whipping he was sure that the negro would
      obey Cobb, and that matters would then move along smoothly.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Mr. Pelham arrived, he left the stage at the cross-roads, half a mile
      from his house, and carpet-bag in hand, walked home through his own
      fields. He was a short, thick-set man of about sixty, round-faced,
      blue-eyed, and gray-haired. He wore a sack-coat, top-boots, and baggy
      trousers. He had a good-natured, kindly face, and walked with the quick
      step and general air of a busy man.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had traveled three hundred miles, slept on the hard seat of a jolting
      train, eaten railroad pies and peanuts, and was covered with the grime of
      a dusty journey, all to whip one disobedient negro. Still, he was not out
      of humor, and after the whipping and lecture to his old servant he would
      travel back over the tiresome route and resume his business where he had
      left it.
    </p>
    <p>
      His wife and sister-in-law were in the kitchen when they heard his step in
      the long hall. They went into the sitting-room, where he had put down his
      carpet-bag, and in the center of the floor stood swinging his hat and
      mopping his brow with his red handkerchief. He shook hands with the two
      women, and then sat down in his old seat in the chimney-corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You want a bite to eat, an&rsquo; a cup of coffee, I reckon,&rdquo; said Mrs. Pelham,
      solicitously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I kin wait till dinner. Whar&rsquo;s Cobb?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I seed &rsquo;im at the wagon-shed a minute ago,&rdquo; spoke up Miss Molly; &ldquo;he was
      expectin&rsquo; you, an&rsquo; didn&rsquo;t go to the field with the balance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell &rsquo;im I want to see &lsquo;im.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Both of the women went out, and the overseer came in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bad state of affairs, Brother Cobb,&rdquo; said the planter, as he shook hands.
      They both sat down with their knees to the embers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That it is, Brother Pelham, an&rsquo; I take it you didn&rsquo;t count on it any more
      &rsquo;n I did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never dreamt of it. Has he been doin&rsquo; any better since he heerd I was
      comin&rsquo; to&mdash;whip &lsquo;im?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not fer me, Brother Pelham. He hain&rsquo;t done a lick fer me; but all of his
      own accord, in the last week, he has broke and sowed all that meadow-piece
      in wheat, an&rsquo; is now harrowin&rsquo; it down to hide it from the birds. To do
      &rsquo;im jestice, I hain&rsquo;t seed so much work done in six days by any human
      bein&rsquo; alive. He &rsquo;ll work for hisse&rsquo;f, but he won&rsquo;t budge fer me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pelham broke into a soft, impulsive laugh, as if at the memory of
      something.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They all had a big joke on me out in North Carolina,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I tol&rsquo;
      &rsquo;em I was comin&rsquo; home to whip a nigger, an&rsquo; they wouldn&rsquo;t believe a word
      of it. I reckon it is the fust time a body ever went so fur on sech
      business. They &lsquo;lowed I was jest homesick an&rsquo; wanted a&rsquo; excuse to come
      back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They don&rsquo;t know what a difficult subject we got to handle,&rdquo; Cobb replied.
      &ldquo;You are, without doubt, the only man in seven states that could whip &lsquo;im,
      Brother Pelham. I believe on my soul he&rsquo;d kill anybody else that&rsquo;d tech
      &lsquo;im. He&rsquo;s got the strangest notions about the rights of niggers I ever
      heerd from one of his kind. He&rsquo;s jest simply dangerous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You &lsquo;re afeard of &lsquo;im, Brother Cobb, an&rsquo; he&rsquo;s sharp enough to see it;
      that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The overseer winced. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t reckon I&rsquo;m any more so than any other white
      man would be under the same circumstances. Henry mought not strike back
      lick fer lick on the spot&mdash;I say he mought not; an&rsquo; then ag&rsquo;in he
      mought&mdash;but he&rsquo;d git even by some hook or crook, or I&rsquo;m no judge o&rsquo;
      niggers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pelham rose. &ldquo;Whar is he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Over in the wheat-field.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you go over thar n&rsquo; tell &rsquo;im I&rsquo;m here, an&rsquo; to come right away down
      in the woods by the gum spring. I &rsquo;ll go down an&rsquo; cut some hickory withes
      an&rsquo; wait fer &lsquo;im. The quicker it&rsquo;s done an&rsquo; over, the deeper the
      impression will be made on &lsquo;im. You see, I want &rsquo;im to realize that all
      this trip is jest solely on his account. I &rsquo;ll start back early in the
      mornin&rsquo;. That will have its weight on his future conduct. An&rsquo;, Brother
      Cobb, I can&rsquo;t&mdash;I jest <i>can&rsquo;t</i> afford to be bothered ag&rsquo;in. My
      business out thar at the lumber-camp won&rsquo;t admit of it. This whippin&rsquo; has
      got to do fer the rest of the year. I think he &rsquo;ll mind you when I git
      through with &lsquo;im. I like &rsquo;im better &rsquo;n any slave I ever owned, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;d a
      thousand times ruther take the whippin&rsquo; myself; but it&rsquo;s got to be done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cobb took himself to Henry in the wheat-field, and the planter went down
      into the edge of the woods near the spring. With his pocket-knife he cut
      two slender hickory switches about five feet in length. He trimmed off the
      out-shooting twigs and knots, and rounded the butts smoothly.
    </p>
    <p>
      From where he sat on a fallen log, he could see, across the boggy swamp of
      bulrushes, the slight rise on which Henry was at work. He could hear
      Henry&rsquo;s mellow, resonant &ldquo;Haw&rdquo; and &ldquo;Gee,&rdquo; as he drove his mule and harrow
      from end to end of the field, and saw Cobb slowly making his way toward
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pelham laid the switches down beside him, put his knife in his pocket,
      and stroked his chin thoughtfully. Suddenly he felt a tight sensation in
      his throat. The solitary figure of the negro as he trudged along by the
      harrow seemed vaguely pathetic. Henry had always been such a noble fellow,
      so reliable and trustworthy. They had really been, in one way, more like
      brothers than master and slave. He had told Henry secrets that he had
      confided to no other human being, and they had laughed and cried together
      over certain adventures and sorrows. About ten years before, Mr. Pelham&rsquo;s
      horse had run away and thrown him against a tree and broken his leg. Henry
      had heard his cries and run to him. They were two miles from the
      farmhouse, and it was a bitterly cold day, but the stalwart negro had
      taken him in his arms and carried him home and laid him down on his bed.
      There had been a great deal of excitement about the house, and it was not
      until after the doctor had come and dressed the broken limb that it was
      learned that Henry had fallen in a swoon in his cabin and lain there
      unconscious for an hour, his wife and children being away. Indeed, he had
      been almost as long recovering as had been his master.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry had stopped his mule. Cobb had called to him, and was approaching.
      Then Mr. Pelham knew that the overseer was delivering his message, for the
      negro had turned his head and was looking toward the woods which hid his
      master from view. Mr. Pelham felt himself flush all over. Could he be
      going to whip Henry&mdash;really to lash his bare back with those
      switches? How strange it seemed all at once! And that this should be their
      first meeting after a two months&rsquo; separation!
    </p>
    <p>
      In his home-comings before, Uncle Henry had always been the first to meet
      him with outstretched hand. But the negro had to be whipped. Mr. Pelham
      had said it in North Carolina; he had said it to Cobb, and he had written
      it to his wife. Yes, it must be done; and if done at all, of course it
      must be done right.
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw Henry hitch his mule to a chestnut-tree in the field and Cobb turn
      to make his way back to the farm-house. Then he watched Henry approaching
      till the bushes which skirted the field hid him from view. There was no
      sound for several minutes except the rustling of the fallen leaves in the
      woods behind him, and then Uncle Henry&rsquo;s head and shoulders appeared above
      the broom-sedge near by.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Howdy do, Marse Jasper?&rdquo; he cried; and the next instant he broke through
      the yellow sedge and stood before his master.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Purty well, Henry.&rdquo; Mr. Pelham could not refuse the black hand which was
      extended, and which caught his with a hearty grasp. &ldquo;I hope you are as
      well as common, Henry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never better in my life, Marse Jasper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The planter had risen, but he now sat down beside his switches. For a
      moment nothing was said. Uncle Henry awkwardly bent his body and his neck
      to see if his mule were standing where he had left him, and his master
      looked steadfastly at the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down, Henry,&rdquo; he said, presently; and the negro took a seat on the
      extreme end of the log and folded his black, seamed hands over his knee.
      &ldquo;I want to talk to you first of all. Something of a very unpleasant,
      unavoidable nature has got to take place betwixt us, an&rsquo; I want to give
      you a sound talkin&rsquo; to beforehan&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, Marse Jasper; I&rsquo;m a-listenin&rsquo;.&rdquo; Henry looked again toward his
      mule. &ldquo;I did want to harrow that wheat down &lsquo;fore them birds eat it up;
      but I got time, I reckon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The planter coughed and cleared his throat. He tried to cross his short,
      fat legs by sliding the right one up to the knee of the left, but owing to
      the lowness of the log, he was unable to do this, so he left his legs to
      themselves, and with a hand on either side of him, leaned back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you remember, Uncle Henry, twenty years ago, when you belonged to old
      Heaton Pelzer an&rsquo; got to hankerin&rsquo; after that yellow girl of mine jest
      after I bought her in South Carolina?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mighty plain, Master Jasper, mighty plain.&rdquo; Henry&rsquo;s face showed a
      tendency to smile at the absurdity of the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lucinda was jest as much set after you, it seemed,&rdquo; went on the planter.
      &ldquo;Old Pelzer was workin&rsquo; you purty nigh to death on his pore, wore-out
      land, an&rsquo; pointedly refused to buy Lucinda so you could marry her, nur he
      wouldn&rsquo;t consent to you marryin&rsquo; a slave of mine. Ain&rsquo;t that so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Marse Jasper, that&rsquo;s so, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had jest as many niggers as I could afford to keep, an&rsquo; a sight more. I
      was already up to my neck in debt, an&rsquo; to buy you I knowed I&rsquo;d have to
      borrow money an&rsquo; mortgage the last thing I had. But you come to me night
      after night, when you could sneak off, an&rsquo; begged an&rsquo; begged to be bought,
      so that I jest didn&rsquo;t have the heart to refuse. So, jest to accommodate
      you, I got up the money an&rsquo; bought you, payin&rsquo; fully a third more fer you
      than men of yore age was goin&rsquo; at. You are married now, an&rsquo; got three as
      likely children as ever come into the world, an&rsquo; a big buxom wife that
      loves you, an&rsquo; if I haven&rsquo;t treated you an&rsquo; them right I never heerd of
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never was a better master on earth, Marse Jasper. If thar is, I hain&rsquo;t
      never seed &lsquo;im.&rdquo; Henry&rsquo;s face was full of emotion. He picked up his slouch
      hat from the grass and folded it awkwardly on the log beside him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From that day till this,&rdquo; the planter went on, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been over my head in
      debt, an&rsquo; I can really trace it to that transaction. It was the straw that
      broke the camel&rsquo;s back, as the feller said. Well, now, Henry, six months
      ago, when I saw that openin&rsquo; to deal in lumber in North Carolina, it
      seemed to me to be my chance to work out of debt, if I could jest find
      somebody to look after my farm. I found a man, Henry&mdash;a good, clever,
      honest man, as everybody Said, an&rsquo; a member of Big Bethel Church. For a
      certain consideration he agreed to take charge. That consideration I&rsquo;ve
      paid in advance, an&rsquo; it&rsquo;s gone; I couldn&rsquo;t git it back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, how has it turned out? I had hardly got started out thar before one
      of my niggers&mdash;the very one I relied on the most&mdash;has played
      smash with all my plans. You begun by turnin&rsquo; up yore nose at Brother
      Cobb, an&rsquo; then by openly disobeyin&rsquo; &lsquo;im. Then he tried to punish you&mdash;the
      right that the law gives a overseer&mdash;an&rsquo; you up an&rsquo; dared him to tech
      you, an&rsquo;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marse Jasper&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold yore tongue till I&rsquo;m through.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, Marse Jasper, but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You openly defied &lsquo;im, that&rsquo;s enough; you broke up the order of the whole
      thing, an&rsquo; yore mistress was so upset that she had to send fer me. Now,
      Henry, I hain&rsquo;t never laid the lash on you in my life, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;d ruther take
      it myself than to have to do it, but I hain&rsquo;t come three hundred miles
      jest to talk to you. I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to whip you, Henry, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to do it
      right, if thar&rsquo;s enough strength in my arm. You needn&rsquo;t shake yore head
      an&rsquo; sulk. No matter what you refused to let Cobb an&rsquo; the rest of &rsquo;em do,
      you are a-goin&rsquo; to take what I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to give you without a word, because
      you know it&rsquo;s just an&rsquo; right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Henry&rsquo;s face was downcast, and his master could not see his eyes, but a
      strange, rebellious fire had suddenly kindled in them, and he was
      stubbornly silent. Mr. Pelham could not have dreamed of what was passing
      in his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Henry, you an&rsquo; me are both religious men,&rdquo; said the planter, after he had
      waited for a moment. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s kneel right down here by this log an&rsquo; commune
      with the Lord on this matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Without a word the negro rose and knelt, his face in his hands, his elbows
      on the log. There never had been a moment when Uncle Henry was not ready
      to pray or listen to a prayer. He prided himself on his own powers in that
      line, and had unbounded respect even for the less skillful efforts of
      others. Mr. Pelham knelt very deliberately and began to pray:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our heavenly Father, it is with extreme sadness an&rsquo; sorrow that we come
      to Thee this bright, sunny day. Our sins have been many, an&rsquo; we hardly
      know when our deeds are acceptable in Thy sight; but bless all our
      efforts, we pray Thee, for the sake of Him that died for us, an&rsquo; let us
      not walk into error in our zeal to do Thy holy will.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord, Thou knowest the hearts of Thy humble supplicant an&rsquo; this man
      beside him. Thou, through the existin&rsquo; laws of this land, hast put him
      into my care an&rsquo; keepin&rsquo; an&rsquo; made me responsible to a human law for his
      good or bad behavior. Lord, on this occasion it seems my duty to punish
      him for disobedience, an&rsquo; we pray Thee to sanction what is about to take
      place with Thy grace. Let no anger or malice rest in our hearts during the
      performance of this disagreeable task, an&rsquo; let the whole redound to Thy
      glory, for ever an&rsquo; ever, through the mercy of Thy Son, our Lord Jesus
      Christ. Amen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pelham rose to his feet stiffly, for he had touches of rheumatism, and
      the ground was cold. He brushed his trousers, and laid hold of his
      switches. But to his surprise, Henry had not risen. If it had not been for
      the stiffness of his elbows, and the upright position of his long feet,
      which stood on their toes erect as gate-posts, Mr. Pelham might have
      thought that he had dropped asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment the planter stood silent, glancing first at the mass of
      ill-clothed humanity at his feet, and then sweeping his eyes over the
      quiet, rolling land which lay between him and the farmhouse. How awfully
      still everything was! He saw Henry&rsquo;s cabin near the farmhouse. Lucinda was
      out in the yard picking up chips, and one of Uncle Henry&rsquo;s children was
      clinging to her skirts. The planter was very fond of Lucinda, and he
      wondered what she would do if she knew he was about to whip her husband.
      But why did the fellow not get up? Surely that was an unusual way to act.
      In some doubt as to what he ought to do, Mr. Pelham sat down again. It
      should not be said of him that he had ever interrupted any man&rsquo;s prayers
      to whip him. As he sat down, the log rolled slightly, the elbows of the
      negro slid off the bark, and Henry&rsquo;s head almost came in contact with the
      log. But he took little notice of the accident, and glancing at his master
      from the corner of his eye, he deliberately replaced his elbows, pressed
      his hands together, and began to pray aloud:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our heavenly Father.&rdquo; These words were spoken in a deep, sonorous tone,
      and as Uncle Henry paused for an instant the echoes groaned and murmured
      and died against the hill behind him. Mr. Pelham bowed his head to his
      hand. He had heard Henry pray before, and now he dreaded hearing him, he
      hardly knew why. He felt a strange creeping sensation in his spine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our heavenly Father,&rdquo; the slave repeated, in his mellow sing-song tone,
      &ldquo;Thou knowest that I am Thy humble servant. Thou knowest that I have
      brought to Thee all my troubles since my change of heart&mdash;that I have
      left nothing hidden from Thee, who art my Maker, my Redeemer, an&rsquo; my Lord.
      Thou knowest that I have for a long time harbored the belief that the
      black man has some rights that he don&rsquo;t git under existin&rsquo; laws, but
      which, Thy will be done, will come in due time, like the harvest follows
      the plantin&rsquo;. Thou know-est, an&rsquo; I know, that Henry Pelham is nigher to
      Thee than a dumb brute, an&rsquo; that it ain&rsquo;t no way to lift a nigger up to
      beat &rsquo;im like a horse or a ox. I have said this to Thee in secret prayer,
      time an&rsquo; ag&rsquo;in, an&rsquo; Thou knowest how I stand on it, if my master don&rsquo;t.
      Thou knowest that before Thee I have vowed that I would die before any
      man, white or black, kin beat the blood out &rsquo;n my back. I may have brought
      trouble an&rsquo; vexation to Marse Jasper, I don&rsquo;t dispute that, but he had no
      business puttin&rsquo; me under that low-down, white-trash overseer an&rsquo; goin&rsquo;
      off so far. Heavenly Father, thou knowest I love Marse Jasper, an&rsquo; I would
      work fer &rsquo;im till I die; but he is ready to put the lash to me an&rsquo;
      disgrace me before my wife an&rsquo; children. Give my arms strength, Lord, to
      defend myself even against him&mdash;against him who has, up to now, won
      my respect an&rsquo; love by forbearance an&rsquo; kindness. He has said it, Lord&mdash;he
      has said that he will whip me; but I&rsquo;ve said, also, that no man shall do
      it. Give me strength to battle fer the right, an&rsquo; if he is hurt&mdash;bad
      hurt&mdash;may the Lord have mercy on him! This I ask through the mercy
      an&rsquo; the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Henry rose awkwardly to his feet and looked down at his master, who sat
      silent on the log. Mr. Pelham&rsquo;s face was pale. There was a look of
      indecision under the pallor. He held one of the switches by the butt in
      his hand, and with its tapering end tapped the brown leaves between his
      legs. He looked at the imperturbable countenance of the negro for fully a
      minute before he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean to say, Henry,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;that you are a-goin&rsquo; to resist me
      by force?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon I am, Marse Jasper, if nothin&rsquo; else won&rsquo;t do you. That&rsquo;s what I
      have promised the Lord time an&rsquo; ag&rsquo;in since Cobb come to boss me. I wasn&rsquo;t
      thinkin&rsquo; about you then, Marse Jasper, because I didn&rsquo;t &rsquo;low you ever
      would try such a thing; but I said <i>any</i> white man, an&rsquo; I can&rsquo;t take
      it back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The planter looked up at the stalwart man towering over him. Henry could
      toss him about like a ball. In his imagination he had pictured the
      faithful fellow bowed before him, patiently submitting to his blows, but
      the present contingency had never entered his mind. He tried to be angry,
      but the goodnatured face of the slave he loved made it impossible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down thar, Henry,&rdquo; he said; and when the negro had obeyed, he
      continued, almost appealingly: &ldquo;I have told the folks in North Carolina
      that I was comin&rsquo; home to whip you, you see. I have told yore mistress,
      an&rsquo; I have told Cobb. I &rsquo;ll look like a purty fool if I don&rsquo;t do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A regretful softness came into the face of the negro, and he hung his
      head, and for a moment picked at the bark of the log with his long
      thumbnail.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m mighty sorry, Marse Jasper,&rdquo; he answered, after remaining silent for
      a while. &ldquo;But you see I&rsquo;ve done promised the Lord; you wouldn&rsquo;t have me&mdash;what
      do all them folks amount to beside the Lord? No; a body ought to be
      careful about what he&rsquo;s promised the Almighty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pelham had no reply forthcoming. He realized that he was simply not
      going to whip Uncle Henry, and he did not want to appear ridiculous in the
      eyes of his friends. The negro saw by his master&rsquo;s silence that he was
      going to escape punishment, and that made him more humble and sympathetic
      than ever. He was genuinely sorry for his master.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have done told &rsquo;em all you was goin&rsquo; to whip me, I know, Marse
      Jasper; but why don&rsquo;t you jest let &rsquo;em think you done it? I don&rsquo;t keer,
      jest so I kin keep my word. Lucinda ain&rsquo;t a-goin&rsquo; to believe I&rsquo;d take it,
      nohow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this loophole of escape the face of the planter brightened. For a
      moment he felt like grasping Henry&rsquo;s hand: then a cloud came over his
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; he demurred, &ldquo;what about yore future conduct? Will you mind what
      Cobb tells you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I jest can&rsquo;t do that, Marse Jasper. Me &rsquo;n him jest can&rsquo;t git along
      together. He ain&rsquo;t no man at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what on earth am I to do? I&rsquo;ve got to have an overseer, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ve
      got to go back to North Carolina.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to have no overseer fer me, Marse Jasper. Have I ever
      failed to keep a promise to you, Marse Jasper?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; but I can&rsquo;t be here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I &rsquo;ll tell you what I &rsquo;ll do, Marse Jasper. Would you be satisfied with
      my part of the work if I tend all the twenty-acre piece beyond my cabin,
      an&rsquo; make a good crop on it, an&rsquo; look after all the cattle an&rsquo; stock, an&rsquo;
      clear the woodland on the hill an&rsquo; cord up the firewood?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t do it, Henry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I &rsquo;ll come mighty nigh it, Marse Jasper, if you &rsquo;ll let me be my own boss
      an&rsquo; be responsible to you when you git back. Mr. Cobb kin boss the rest of
      &lsquo;em. They don&rsquo;t keer how much he swings his whip an&rsquo; struts around.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Henry, I &rsquo;ll do it. I can trust you a sight better than I can Cobb. I
      know you will keep yore word. But you will not say anything about&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a word, Marse Jasper. They all may &rsquo;low I&rsquo;m half dead, if they want
      to.&rdquo; Then the two men laughed together heartily and parted.
    </p>
    <p>
      The overseer and the two white women were waiting for Mr. Pelham in the
      backyard as he emerged from the woods and came toward the house. Mrs.
      Pelham opened the gate for him, scanning his face anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was afeard you an&rsquo; Henry had had some difficulty,&rdquo; she said, in a tone
      of relief; &ldquo;he has been that hard to manage lately.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pelham grunted and laughed in disdain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I &rsquo;ll bet he was the hardest you ever tackled,&rdquo; ventured Cobb.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anybody can manage him,&rdquo; the planter replied&mdash;&ldquo;anybody that has got
      enough determination. You see Henry knows me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But do you think he &rsquo;ll obey my orders after you go back?&rdquo; Cobb had
      followed Mr. Pelham into the sitting-room, and he anxiously waited for the
      reply to his question.
    </p>
    <p>
      The planter stooped to spit into a corner of the chimney, and then slowly
      and thoughtfully stroked his chin with his hand. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the only trouble,
      Brother Cobb,&rdquo; he said, thrusting his fat hands into the pockets of his
      trousers and turning his back to the fire-place; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s the only
      drawback. To be plain with you, Brother Cobb, I&rsquo;m afeard you don&rsquo;t inspire
      respect; men that don&rsquo;t own niggers seldom do. I believe on my soul that
      nigger would die fightin&rsquo; before he&rsquo;d obey yore orders. To tell the truth,
      I had to arrange a plan, an&rsquo; that is one reason&mdash;one reason&mdash;why
      I was down thar so long. After what happened today&rdquo; (Mr. Pelham spoke
      significantly and stroked his chin again) &ldquo;he &rsquo;ll mind me jest as well at
      a distance as if I was here on the spot. He&rsquo;d have a mortal dread of
      havin&rsquo; me come so fur ag&rsquo;in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you wasn&rsquo;t cruel, Mr. Pelham,&rdquo; said Mrs. Pelham, who had just come
      in. &ldquo;Henry&rsquo;s so good-hearted&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he &rsquo;ll git over it,&rdquo; replied the planter, ambiguously. &ldquo;But, as I was
      goin&rsquo; on to say, I had to fix another plan. I have set him a sort o&rsquo; task
      to do while I&rsquo;m away, an&rsquo; I believe he &rsquo;ll do it, Brother Cobb. So all you
      &rsquo;ll have to do will be to look after the other niggers.&rdquo; The plan suited
      Cobb exactly; but when Mr. Pelham came home the following summer it was
      hard to hear him say that Uncle Henry had accomplished more than any three
      of the other negroes.

      A FILIAL IMPULSE
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">Y</span> o&rsquo; &lsquo;re purty well
      fixed, Jim; I wish I had yore business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Big Jim Bradley glanced slowly around his store. The heaps of flour-sacks,
      coffee-bags, sugar-barrels, piles of bacon, crates of hams, kits of
      mackerel, and the long rows of well-filled shelves brought a flush of
      satisfaction into his rugged face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hain&rsquo;t no reason to complain, Bob,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve been in Georgia, an&rsquo;
      you know how blamed hard it is fer a feller to make his salt back thar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now yo&rsquo; &lsquo;re a-talkin&rsquo;&mdash;yo&rsquo; &lsquo;re a-sayin&rsquo; some &lsquo;n&rsquo; now!&rdquo; Bob Lash was
      sitting on the head of a potato-barrel, eating cheese and crackers, and
      his spirited words were interspersed with little snowy puffs from the
      corners of his mouth. &ldquo;Jim,&rdquo; he continued, in a muffled tone, as he eased
      his feet down to the floor, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a-goin&rsquo; to wash this dry truck down with
      a glass o&rsquo; yore cider; I&rsquo;m about to choke. Thar&rsquo;s yore nickel. You needn&rsquo;t
      rise; I can wait on myse&rsquo;f.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d keep my eye open while he was behind the counter, Jim,&rdquo; put in Henry
      Webb, jestingly. &ldquo;Bob&rsquo;s got a swallow like a mill-race. He may take a
      notion to drink out of yore half-gallon measure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Had to drink out &rsquo;n a thimble, or some &lsquo;n&rsquo; &rsquo;bout the size of it, at yore
      place when you kept a bar,&rdquo; gurgled Bob in the cider-glass. &ldquo;But I hain&rsquo;t
      nothin&rsquo; ag&rsquo;in you; the small doses of the stuff you sold was all that
      saved my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The flashily dressed young man sitting at Webb&rsquo;s side laughed and slapped
      him familiarly on the knee. His name was Thornton. He used to &ldquo;mix drinks&rdquo;
       for Webb, and had been out of employment ever since his employer&rsquo;s
      establishment had been closed by the sheriff, a few months before. &ldquo;One on
      you, Harry,&rdquo; he said, laughing again at the comical expression on his
      friend&rsquo;s face; &ldquo;you have to get up before day to get the best o&rsquo; these
      Georgia mossbacks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Webb said nothing; and Bob, blushing triumphantly under Thornton&rsquo;s
      compliment, and chewing a chip of dried beef that he had found on the
      counter, came back to his seat on the barrel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I reckon I <i>have</i> done middlin&rsquo; well,&rdquo; said Jim, bringing the
      conversation back to his own affairs with as much adroitness as he was
      capable of exercising. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t have a dollar to my name when I struck
      this town, ten year back. I started as a waiter in a restaurant nigh the
      railroad shops, then run a lemonade-stand at the park, an&rsquo; by makin&rsquo; every
      lick count, I gradually worked up to this shebang.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Henry Webb seemed to grow serious. He glanced stealthily at Thornton when
      Jim was not looking, crossed his legs nervously, and said: &ldquo;Jim, me an&rsquo;
      you have been dickerin&rsquo; long enough; all this roundabout talk don&rsquo;t bring
      us an inch nearer a trade. Now I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to make you my last proposition
      about this stock o&rsquo; goods. My wife got her money out of her minin&rsquo;
      interest to-day, an&rsquo; wants to put it in some regular business o&rsquo; this
      sort. I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to make you a round bid on the whole thing, lock, stock,
      an&rsquo; barrel, an&rsquo;, on my honor, it&rsquo;s my last offer. I &rsquo;ll give you ten
      thousand dollars in cash fer the key to the door.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Everybody in the group was fully conscious of the vital importance of the
      words which had just been spoken. Webb, who was a famous poker-player, had
      never controlled his face and tone better. No one spoke for a moment, but
      all eyes were fixed expectantly on Bradley. &ldquo;Huh,&rdquo; he answered, half under
      his breath, &ldquo;I reckon you would!&rdquo; He tossed his shaggy, iron-gray head and
      smiled artificially. His face was pale, and his eyes shone with suppressed
      excitement. It was a better offer than he had expected; in fact, he had
      not realized before that his stock was convertible into quite so much
      ready money, and it was hard for him, simple and honest as he was, to keep
      from showing surprise. &ldquo;Harry Webb,&rdquo; he went on, evasively, &ldquo;do you have
      any idee what I cleared last year, not countin&rsquo; bad debts an&rsquo; expenses?
      I&rsquo;m over three thousand ahead, an&rsquo; prospects fer trade never was better.
      My books will show you that I am a-givin&rsquo; it to you straight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Webb made no reply. If he had been as sure of his own moral worth as he
      was of Jim&rsquo;s he would have been a better man. As it was, he only looked
      significantly at Thornton, who had evidently come prepared to play a part.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t no business o&rsquo; mine, fellers, one way or the other,&rdquo; began
      Thornton, slightly confused. He cleared his throat and spat on the floor.
      &ldquo;But I &rsquo;ll admit I&rsquo;m kinder anxious to see Harry get into some settled
      business. You know he&rsquo;s mighty changeable, one day runnin&rsquo; some
      fortune-wheel or card-table, an&rsquo; the next got charge of a side-show, bar,
      or skating-rink, and never makes much stake at anything. I told his wife
      to-day that I&rsquo;d do my best to get you fellers to come to a understanding.
      That&rsquo;s all the interest I&rsquo;ve got in the matter; but I&rsquo;d bet my last chip
      you&rsquo;d have to look a long ways before you could find another buyer with
      that much ready cash such times as these.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huh, you don&rsquo;t say!&rdquo; sneered Jim, a cold gleam of indecision and
      excitement in the glance that he accidentally threw to Bob Lash, who
      erroneously fancied that his friend wanted him to say something to offset
      the remarks made by Webb&rsquo;s ally. But diplomacy was not one of the few
      gifts with which frugal nature had blessed Bob, and when the idea struck
      him that he ought to speak, he grew very agitated, and almost stabbed a
      hole in one of his cheeks with the long splinter with which he was picking
      his teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The man that gits it has a purty dead-shore thing fer a comfortable
      income,&rdquo; he blurted out, incautiously. &ldquo;I wish I had the money to secure
      it; I&rsquo;d plank it down so quick it &lsquo;u&rsquo;d make yore head swim.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jim flushed. &ldquo;Nobody hain&rsquo;t said nothin&rsquo; &rsquo;bout the shebang bein&rsquo; on the
      market,&rdquo; he said, quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bob saw his mistake too late to rectify it, so he said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Webb smiled, and rose with an easy assumption of indifference and lighted
      a fresh cigar over the lamp-chimney. &ldquo;Tibbs wants to rent me the new
      store-room joining you, Jim,&rdquo; he said, rolling his cigar into the corner
      of his mouth and half closing the eye which was in direct line with the
      rising smoke. &ldquo;I kinder thought I&rsquo;d like them big plate-glass
      show-windows. Ten thousand dollars in bran-new groceries wouldn&rsquo;t be bad,
      would they?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jim was taken slightly aback, but he recovered himself in an instant. &ldquo;Not
      ef they was bought jest right, Harry,&rdquo; he said, significantly. &ldquo;A man <i>mought</i>
      have a purty fair start that way, ef he was experienced; but law me! I&rsquo;d
      hate awful to start to lay in a stock frum these cussed drummers; they are
      wholesale bunco-sharks. An&rsquo; then, you see, I&rsquo;ve been here sence this town
      fust started, an&rsquo; I know who will do to credit an&rsquo; who won&rsquo;t. My blacklist
      is wuth five thousand to any man in this line. Thar&rsquo;s men in this town
      that &rsquo;ll pay a gamblin&rsquo; debt &lsquo;thout a bobble, an&rsquo; cuss like rips at the
      sight of a grocery bill. But thar ain&rsquo;t no use talkin&rsquo;; I reckon my
      business ain&rsquo;t fer sale.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Webb turned to Thornton and coolly asked for a match; then the entire
      group was silent till Bob Lash spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How in the world did you ever happen to come &rsquo;way out here, anyway, Jim?&rdquo;
       he asked, obtusely believing that Bradley meant exactly what he had said
      in regard to Webb&rsquo;s proposition, and that for all concerned it would be
      more agreeable and profitable to talk about something else.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Got tired an&rsquo; wanted a change,&rdquo; grunted Bradley. &ldquo;I never was treated
      exactly right by my folks, an&rsquo; was itchin&rsquo; awful to make money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What county did you say you was from?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gilmer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Webb yawned aloud, puffed at his cigar, and swept the store from end to
      end with a rather critical, would-be dissatisfied glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I passed through thar goin&rsquo; from Dalton to Canton,&rdquo; went on Bob, warming
      up. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a purty country through them mountains. What was you a-follerin&rsquo;
      back thar?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Farmin&rsquo; it. Thar was jest three uv us&mdash;me an&rsquo; brother Joe an&rsquo;
      mother; but we couldn&rsquo;t git along together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a pity!&rdquo; said Bob.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I al&rsquo;ays wanted to make money,&rdquo; went on Jim, &ldquo;an&rsquo; atter the old man died
      I was anxious fer me an&rsquo; Joe to save up enough to git a farm uv our own;
      but he tuk to drinkin&rsquo; an&rsquo; spreein&rsquo; round generally, an&rsquo; was al&rsquo;ays off
      jest when the crop needed the most attention. I al&rsquo;ays was easy irritated,
      an&rsquo; never could be satisfied onless I was goin&rsquo; ahead. Me an&rsquo; Joe was
      eternally a-fussin&rsquo;, an&rsquo; mother al&rsquo;ays tuk his part. One night she got
      rippin&rsquo; mad, an&rsquo; &lsquo;lowed that she could git along better with &rsquo;im ef I
      wasn&rsquo;t thar to make trouble, an&rsquo; so I made up my mind to come West. I tol&rsquo;
      &rsquo;em they was welcome to my intrust in the crap, an that I had had all I
      could stand up under, an&rsquo; was goin&rsquo; off. Mother never even said farewell,
      an&rsquo; Joe sorter turned up his nose, an&rsquo; &lsquo;lowed I&rsquo;d be writin&rsquo; back an&rsquo;
      beggin&rsquo; fer money to git home on &lsquo;fore a month was out. I told mother ef
      she ever needed help to write, but she never looked up from her
      spinnin&rsquo;-wheel, an&rsquo; from that day to this I hain&rsquo;t had a scratch of a
      pen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shorely you didn&rsquo;t leave a old woman in sech hands as that,&rdquo; ventured
      Bob.
    </p>
    <p>
      The expression on Jim Bradley&rsquo;s face changed. &ldquo;What was I to do? Ef I&rsquo;d
      &lsquo;a&rsquo; stayed thar I&rsquo;d &lsquo;a&rsquo; been a beggar to-day,&rdquo; he said, argumentatively.
      &ldquo;I &lsquo;lowed ef I was sech a bother I&rsquo;d leave &lsquo;em; but I &rsquo;ll admit thar are
      times when I think I may &lsquo;a&rsquo; been a leetle hasty. An&rsquo; I do hanker atter
      home folks mighty bad at times, especially when I&rsquo;m locked up in this
      lonely store at night, with nothin&rsquo; but my cat fer company. I&rsquo;ve been
      intendin&rsquo; to write to mother every day, but some &lsquo;n&rsquo; al&rsquo;ays interferes. I
      heerd four year ago, accidentally, that they was gittin&rsquo; &rsquo;long tolerable
      well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s mighty tough on fellers of our age, Jim, to grow old alone in the
      world,&rdquo; sighed Bob, reaching out to the crate for another splinter. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d
      ruther have less money an&rsquo; more rale home comforts. Kin is a great thing.
      Brother Sam sent me a pictur&rsquo; uv his little gal. I wish I had it to show
      you; she&rsquo;s mighty purty an&rsquo; smart-lookin&rsquo;. It made me mighty homesick.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon it did,&rdquo; said Bradley. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seed dogs that lived better than I
      do. D&rsquo; you fellers ever see whar I bunk?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; joined in Thornton and Webb, seeing that they were addressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come into my parlor, then;&rdquo; and Jim grinned, broadly. He lifted the lamp,
      and holding it over his head, he led them through some curtains made of
      cotton bagging into the back room. Empty boxes, hogsheads, crates, bales
      of hay, heaps of old iron, and every sort of rubbish imaginable covered
      the floor. A narrow bed stood by a window between a row of dripping
      syrup-barrels and the greasy wall. &ldquo;Thar&rsquo;s whar I sleep,&rdquo; said Jim,
      pointing to the bed. &ldquo;It hain&rsquo;t been made up in a coon&rsquo;s age. Sometimes
      old Injun Mary changes the sheets an&rsquo; turns the mattress when she happens
      along, but it hain&rsquo;t often. At home I used to sleep in a big
      sweet-smellin&rsquo; bed that was like lyin&rsquo; down in a pile o&rsquo; roses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d think you&rsquo;d git tired o&rsquo; this; I would, by hooky!&rdquo; declared Bob.
      &ldquo;Whar do you git yore grub?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fust one place an&rsquo; then another; I don&rsquo;t bother much about my eatin&rsquo;. I
      have to light out o&rsquo; bed to wait on the fust one that rattles the doorknob
      in the mornin&rsquo;, an&rsquo; am so busy from then on that I cayn&rsquo;t find a minute to
      git a bite o&rsquo; breakfast. See my kettle thar? I can make as good a cup o&rsquo;
      coffee as the next one. Half a cup o&rsquo; ground Javy in my coffeepot, with
      bilin&rsquo; water poured on, an&rsquo; then put on the stove to bile ag&rsquo;in, does the
      business. Thar&rsquo;s my skillet; a cowboy give it to me. Sometimes I fry a
      slice o&rsquo; streak-o&rsquo;-lean-streak-o&rsquo;-fat, ur a few cracked eggs, but it
      hain&rsquo;t half livin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They walked back and sat down in the store again. Bob had a strange,
      perplexed look on his face. Webb was about to make some reference to his
      offer, when Bob forestalled him in a rather excited tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jim, did yore mother live nigh Ellijay?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Bout three miles from town. What in the thunder is the matter? What are
      you starin&rsquo; at me that way fer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bob looked down and moved uneasily on the barrel. &ldquo;I was jest a-wonderin&rsquo;&mdash;my
      Lord, Jim! thar was a feller shot the day I passed through Ellijay. I
      cayn&rsquo;t be shore, but it seems to me his name was Joe Bradley. He was a
      troublesome, rowdyish sort of a feller, an&rsquo; a man had to shoot &rsquo;im in
      self-defense.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jim stared at the speaker helplessly, and then glanced around at Webb and
      Thornton. His great brown eyes began to dilate, and a sickly pallor came
      into his face. His breathing fell distinct and harsh on the profound
      stillness of the room. His mouth dropped open, but he was unable to utter
      a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He may not &lsquo;a&rsquo; been yore brother,&rdquo; added Bob, quickly, and with sympathy.
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not plumb shore o&rsquo; the name, nuther. I was helpin a man drive a drove
      of Kentucky hosses through to Gainesville, an&rsquo; we got thar jest atter the
      shootin&rsquo;. I heerd the shots myse&rsquo;f. The coroner held a inquest, an&rsquo; the
      dead man&rsquo;s mother was thar. She looked pitiful; she was mighty gray an&rsquo;
      old an&rsquo; bent over. I was standin&rsquo; in the edge o&rsquo; the crowd when some
      neighbor fotch&rsquo; &rsquo;er up in his wagon, an&rsquo; we all made room for &lsquo;er. She had
      the pity of every blessed man thar. She jest stood &rsquo;mongst the rest,
      lookin&rsquo; down at the corpse fer some time &lsquo;thout sayin&rsquo; a word to anybody,
      nur sheddin&rsquo; a tear. Then she seemed to come to &lsquo;erse&rsquo;f, an&rsquo; said, jest as
      ef nothin&rsquo; oncommon had occurred: &lsquo;Well, gentlemen, why don&rsquo;t you move &lsquo;im
      under a shelter?&rsquo; an&rsquo; with that she squatted down at his head, an&rsquo; breshed
      the hair off &rsquo;n his forehead mighty gentle-like. &lsquo;We are a-holdin&rsquo; uv a
      inquest, accordin&rsquo; to law,&rsquo; a big feller said who was the coroner of the
      town. &lsquo;Law ur no law,&rsquo; she said, lookin&rsquo; up at &lsquo;im, her eyes flashin&rsquo; like
      a tiger-cat&rsquo;s, &lsquo;he sha &lsquo;n&rsquo;t lie here in the br&rsquo;ilin&rsquo; sun with no roof over
      &lsquo;im. Thar wasn&rsquo;t no law to keep &rsquo;im from bein&rsquo; murdered right in yore
      midst.&rsquo; An&rsquo; she had her way, you kin bet on that. The men jest lifted &lsquo;im
      up an&rsquo; toted &rsquo;im into the nighest store an&rsquo; put &rsquo;im on a cot. The coroner
      objected, but them men jest cussed &rsquo;im to his face an&rsquo; pushed him away as
      ef he was so much trash.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you take notice o&rsquo; the body?&rdquo; gasped Bradley, finding voice finally.
      &ldquo;What kind of a lookin&rsquo; man was he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ef I remember right, he had sorter reddish hair an&rsquo; blue eyes, an&rsquo; was
      &rsquo;bout yore build. He was a good-lookin&rsquo; man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was brother Joe,&rdquo; said Bradley. He was trembling from head to foot and
      was deathly pale. &ldquo;Well, go on,&rdquo; he said, making a mighty effort to appear
      calm; &ldquo;what about mother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know anything more,&rdquo; said Bob. &ldquo;I left that same day. I heerd
      some talk about her bein&rsquo; left destitute, an&rsquo; ef I ain&rsquo;t mistaken, some
      said her other son had gone off West an&rsquo; died out thar, as nobody had
      heerd from him. That&rsquo;s what made me&mdash;&rdquo; But Bradley interrupted him.
      He rose, with a dazed look on his face, and went to his desk, a few feet
      away. He sat on the high stool and leaned his shaggy head on a pile of
      account-books. An inkstand rolled down to the floor, and a penholder
      rattled after it, but he did not pick them up. Then everything was still.
      Thornton reached over and took Webb&rsquo;s cigar to light his own, instead of
      striking the match he had taken from his pocket. The two men exchanged
      significant glances, and then looked curiously, almost breathlessly, at
      the mute figure bowed over the desk. Bradley raised his head. His eyes
      were bloodshot, and a tangled wisp of his long hair lay across his haggard
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long ago was it, Bob?&rdquo; he asked, in a deep, husky voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two year last May.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My Lord! she may be dead an&rsquo; gone by this time, an&rsquo; I kin never make up
      fer my neglect!&rdquo; He left the desk and came back slowly. &ldquo;Kin you git that
      money to-night?&rdquo; he asked, looking down at Webb.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; by walkin&rsquo; up home.&rdquo; Webb tried to subdue the eager light in his
      eyes, which threatened to betray his intense satisfaction at the sudden
      change of affairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, go git it. I &rsquo;ll pack my satchel while yo&rsquo; &lsquo;re gone. I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to
      leave you fellers fer good, I reckon. I want to git back home. I wish you
      luck with the business, Webb. It&rsquo;s a good investment; we mought never have
      traded ef this hadn&rsquo;t &lsquo;a&rsquo; come up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>

    <p>
      Jim Bradley was worn out with the fatigue of his long journey when he
      alighted from the train in the little town that he had once known so well.
      The place had changed so much that he hardly knew which way to turn. He
      went into a store. The merchant was at his desk behind a railing in the
      rear, and a boy sat in the middle of the floor filling a patent egg-case
      with fresh eggs. &ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; he said, without looking up, and went on with
      his work. Jim put his oilcloth valise on the floor and sat down in a
      chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some &lsquo;n&rsquo; I kin do fer you to-day?&rdquo; asked the boy, rising, and putting the
      lid on the egg-case.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I b&rsquo;lieve not to-day, bub,&rdquo; replied Bradley. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve jest got off &lsquo;n
      the train an&rsquo; stopped in to ax a few questions. The&rsquo; used to be a woman
      livin&rsquo; on the Starks place ten year ago&mdash;a widder woman, Mis&rsquo; Jason
      Bradley; kin you tell me whar I&rsquo;d be likely to find &rsquo;er now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know no sech er person,&rdquo; said the boy; &ldquo;mebby Mr. Summers kin
      tell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean Joe Bradley&rsquo;s mother,&rdquo; said the storekeeper, approaching&mdash;&ldquo;the
      feller that was shot over at Holland&rsquo;s bar?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s the one,&rdquo; said Jim, breathlessly; &ldquo;is she still alive?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hain&rsquo;t heerd nothin&rsquo; to the contrary, but I don&rsquo;t know jest whar she is
      now. She was powerful hard up last winter, an&rsquo; somebody tuk &rsquo;er to live
      with &lsquo;em&mdash;seems to me it was one o&rsquo; the Sanders boys.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A woman entered the door and set her basket on the counter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mis&rsquo; Wade &rsquo;ll be able to tell you,&rdquo; continued the merchant, turning to
      her; &ldquo;she lives over in that direction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that, Mr. Summers?&rdquo; she asked, carefully untying the cloth that
      covered some yellow rolls of butter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This gentleman was askin&rsquo; about the widow Bradley, Joe&rsquo;s mother; do you
      know whar she is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s livin&rsquo; with Alf Sanders,&rdquo; replied the woman; &ldquo;I seed &rsquo;er thar
      soap-bilin&rsquo; as I driv by last Tuesday was a week. Are you any kin o&rsquo;
      hern?&rdquo; and she eyed Bradley curiously from head to foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      He made no reply to her question, though a warm color had suddenly come
      into his face at the words she had spoken. He took up his valise and
      looked out at the setting sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How fer is it out thar?&rdquo; he asked, a tremor in his voice. &ldquo;I want to see
      &rsquo;er to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three mile, I reckon,&rdquo; the woman said. &ldquo;Keep to the big road tel you
      cross the creek, an&rsquo; then turn off to the right. You cayn&rsquo;t miss it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He thanked her, and trudged on past the other stores and the little white
      church on the hill, and on into the road that led toward the mountain.
      Just before entering the woods, he turned and looked back at the village.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O Lord, I&rsquo;m glad I ain&rsquo;t too late entirely,&rdquo; he said; and he took a
      soiled red handkerchief from his pocket and wiped his eyes. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know
      what I would &lsquo;a&rsquo; done ef they&rsquo;d &lsquo;a&rsquo; said she was gone. But I &rsquo;ll never see
      Joe ag&rsquo;in, an&rsquo; that seems quar. Poor boy! me an&rsquo; him used to be mighty
      thick when we was little bits o&rsquo; fellers. I kin remember when he&rsquo;d &lsquo;a&rsquo; fit
      a wildcat to help me, an&rsquo; I got mad at him fer drinkin&rsquo; when he wasn&rsquo;t
      able to he&rsquo;p hisse&rsquo;f. I&rsquo;d hold my peace ef it was to do over ag&rsquo;in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sanders&rsquo; house was a low, four-roomed log cabin which sat back under some
      large beech-trees about a hundred yards from the road. Sanders himself sat
      smoking in the front yard, surrounded by four or five half-clad children
      and several gaunt hunting-dogs. He was a thin, wiry man, with long brown
      hair and beard, and dark, suspicious eyes set close together. He did not
      move or show much concern as Jim Bradley, just at dusk, came wearily up
      the narrow path from the bars to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Down, Ski! Down, Brutus!&rdquo; he called out savagely to his barking dogs, and
      he silenced their uproar by hurling an ax-helve among them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is whar Alf Sanders lives, I reckon,&rdquo; said Bradley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m the feller,&rdquo; replied Sanders. &ldquo;Take a cheer; thar&rsquo;s one handy,&rdquo; and
      he indicated it with a lazy wave of his pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jim sat down mutely. Through the open door in one of the rooms he could
      see the form of a woman moving about in the firelight. He fell to
      trembling, and forgot that he was under the curious inspection of Sanders
      and his children. A moment later, however, when the fire blazed up more
      brightly, he saw that it was not his mother whom he had seen, but a
      younger woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yo&rsquo; &lsquo;re a stranger about here?&rdquo; interrogated Sanders, catching his eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hain&rsquo;t been in this country fer ten year,&rdquo; was the laconic reply. &ldquo;My
      name&rsquo;s Bradley&mdash;Jim Bradley; I&rsquo;ve come back to see my mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My stars! We all &lsquo;lowed you was dead an&rsquo; buried long &lsquo;go!&rdquo; and Sanders
      dropped his pipe in sheer astonishment. &ldquo;Well, ef that don&rsquo;t take the rag
      off &rsquo;n the bush! Mary! Oh, Mary!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What ails you, Alf?&rdquo; asked a slatternly woman, emerging from the
      firelight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come out here a minute. This is the old woman&rsquo;s son Jim, back from the
      West.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yo&rsquo; &lsquo;re a-jokin&rsquo;,&rdquo; she ejaculated, as she came slowly in open-eyed wonder
      toward the visitor. &ldquo;Why, who&rsquo;d &lsquo;a&rsquo; thought&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whar is she?&rdquo; interrupted Bradley, unceremoniously. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come a long
      ways to see &lsquo;er.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s out thar at the cow-lot a-milkin&rsquo;. She tuk &rsquo;er bucket an&rsquo; the feed
      fer Brindle jest now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His eyes followed hers. Beyond a row of alder-bushes and a little patch of
      corn he saw the dim outlines of a log stable and lean-to shed surrounded
      by a snake fence. Away out toward the red-skied west lay green fields and
      meadows under a canopy of blue smoke, and beyond their limits rose the
      frowning mountains, upon the sides of which long, sinuous fires were
      burning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon I ort not to run upon her too sudden,&rdquo; he said, awkwardly,
      &ldquo;bein&rsquo; as she ain&rsquo;t expectin&rsquo; me, an&rsquo; hain&rsquo;t no idee I&rsquo;m alive. Is she
      well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Toler&rsquo;ble,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Sanders, hesitatingly. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s been complainin&rsquo;
      some o&rsquo; headaches lately, an&rsquo; her appetite ain&rsquo;t overly good, but she&rsquo;s up
      an&rsquo; about, an&rsquo; will be powerful glad to see you. She talks about you a
      good deal of late. Jest atter yore brother Joe&rsquo;s death she had &rsquo;im on her
      mind purty constant, but now she al&rsquo;ays has some &lsquo;n&rsquo; to say about Jim&mdash;that&rsquo;s
      yore name, I believe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He nodded silently, not taking his eyes from the cow-lot. His valise
      rolled from his knees down on to the grass, and one of the children
      restored it to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that is a fact,&rdquo; put in Sanders. &ldquo;She was talkin&rsquo; last Sunday about
      her two boys. She al&rsquo;ays calls you the steady one. You ort to be sorter
      cautious. Old folks like her sometimes cayn&rsquo;t stand good news any better
      &rsquo;n bad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I &rsquo;ll be keerful.&rdquo; His voice sounded husky and deep. &ldquo;Does she&mdash;&rdquo; he
      went on hesitatingly&mdash;&ldquo;does she work fer you around the place?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sanders crossed his legs and cleared his throat. &ldquo;That was the
      understandin&rsquo; when we agreed to take &lsquo;er,&rdquo; he said, rather
      consequentially. &ldquo;She was to make &lsquo;erse&rsquo;f handy whenever she was able. My
      wife has had a risin&rsquo; on &rsquo;er arm an&rsquo; couldn&rsquo;t cook, an&rsquo; we&rsquo;ve had five ur
      six field hands here to the&rsquo;r meals. The old critter was willin&rsquo; to do
      anything to git a place to stay. The&rsquo; wasn&rsquo;t any-whar else fer &rsquo;er to go.
      She&rsquo;s too old to do much, but she&rsquo;s willin&rsquo; to put &rsquo;er hands to anything.
      We cayn&rsquo;t complain. She gits peevish now an&rsquo; then, though, an&rsquo; &lsquo;er
      eyesight an&rsquo; memory&rsquo;s a-failin&rsquo;, so that she makes mistakes in the
      cookin&rsquo;. T&rsquo;other day she salted the dough twice an&rsquo; clean furgot to put in
      sody.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s gittin&rsquo; into &rsquo;er second childhood,&rdquo; added Mrs. Sanders, &ldquo;an&rsquo; she
      ain&rsquo;t got our ways in church notions, nuther. She&rsquo;s a Baptist, you know,
      an&rsquo; b&rsquo;lieves in emersion of the entire body an&rsquo; in close communion an&rsquo;
      sechlike, while the last one of us, down to little Sally thar, is
      Methodists. She goes whar we do to meetin&rsquo; &lsquo;ca&rsquo;se her church is too fer
      off an&rsquo; we use the hosses Sundays.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bradley&rsquo;s face was hidden by the dusk and the brim of his slouch hat, and
      they failed to notice the hot flush that rose into his cheeks. He got up
      suddenly and put his valise on a chair. &ldquo;I reckon I mought as well walk
      out to whar she is,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;She won&rsquo;t be apt to know me. I&rsquo;ve turned
      out a beard an&rsquo; got gray sence she seed me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I &rsquo;ll go&rsquo;long with you.&rdquo; But Mrs. Sanders touched her husband on the arm
      as he was rising. &ldquo;It &lsquo;u&rsquo;d look more decent ef you&rsquo;d leave &rsquo;em to
      the&rsquo;rselves, Alf,&rdquo; she whispered. He sat down without a word, and Bradley
      walked away in the dusk to meet his mother. There was a blur before the
      strong man&rsquo;s eyes, and a strange weakness came over him as he leaned
      against the cow-lot fence and tried to think how he would make himself
      known to her. Beneath the low shed, a part of the crude stable, he saw the
      figure of a woman crouched down under a cow. &ldquo;So, so, Brin&rsquo;!&rdquo; she was
      saying softly. &ldquo;Cayn&rsquo;t you stan&rsquo; still a minute? That ain&rsquo;t no way to do.
      So, so!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His heart sank. It was her voice, but it was shrill and quivering, and he
      recognized it only as one does a familiar face under a mask of age. Just
      then, with a sudden exclamation, she sprang up quickly and placed her pail
      on the ground out of the cow&rsquo;s reach. He comprehended the situation at a
      glance. The calf had got through the bars and was sucking its mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord, what &rsquo;ll I do?&rdquo; cried the old woman, in dismay; and catching the
      calf around the neck, she exerted all her strength to separate it from the
      cow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bradley sprang over the fence and ran to her assistance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Le&rsquo; me git a hold o&rsquo; the little scamp,&rdquo; he said, and the next instant he
      had the sleek little animal up in his strong arms. &ldquo;Whar do you want &lsquo;im
      put?&rdquo; he asked, drily, turning to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Outside the lot,&rdquo; she gasped, so astonished that she could hardly utter a
      word.
    </p>
    <p>
      He carried his struggling burden to the fence and dropped it over, and
      fastened up the bars to keep it out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, ef that don&rsquo;t beat all!&rdquo; she laughed, in great relief, when he
      turned back to her. &ldquo;I am very much obleeged. I &lsquo;lowed at fust you was one
      o&rsquo; the field hands.&rdquo; He looked into her wrinkled face closely, but saw no
      sign of recognition there. She put the corner of her little
      breakfast-shawl to her poor wrinkled mouth and broke out into a low,
      childlike laugh. &ldquo;I cayn&rsquo;t help from being amused at the way you tuk up
      that calf; I don&rsquo;t know&rdquo; (and the smile left her face) &ldquo;what I&rsquo;d &lsquo;a&rsquo; done
      ef you hadn&rsquo;t &lsquo;a&rsquo; come along. I never could &lsquo;a&rsquo; turned it out, an&rsquo; Alf&rsquo;s
      wife never kin be pacified when sech a thing happens. We don&rsquo;t git enough
      milk, anyway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Le&rsquo; me finish milkin&rsquo;,&rdquo; he said, keeping his face half averted.
    </p>
    <p>
      She laughed again. &ldquo;Yo&rsquo; &lsquo;re a-jokin&rsquo; now; I never seed a <i>man</i> milk a
      cow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never did nuther tel I went out West,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;The Yankees out
      thar showed me how. I&rsquo;m a old bach&rsquo;, an&rsquo; used to keep a cow o&rsquo; my own, an&rsquo;
      thar wasn&rsquo;t nobody but me to tend &lsquo;er.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stood by his side and laughed like a child amused with a new toy when
      he took her place at the cow, and with the pail between his knees and
      using both hands, began to milk rapidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never seed the like,&rdquo; he heard her muttering over and over to herself.
      Then he rose and showed her the pail nearly filled. &ldquo;I reckon that calf
      &lsquo;u&rsquo;d have a surprise-party ef he was to try on his suckin&rsquo; business now,&rdquo;
       he said. &ldquo;It serves &rsquo;im right fer bein&rsquo; so rampacious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Law me! I never could git that much,&rdquo; she said, and she held out her hand
      for the pail, but he swung it down at his side. &ldquo;I &rsquo;ll tote it,&rdquo; he said;
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a-goin&rsquo; back to the house. I reckon I &rsquo;ll put up thar fer the night&mdash;that
      is, ef they &rsquo;ll take me in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve jest been lookin&rsquo; at you an&rsquo; wonderin&rsquo;,&rdquo; she said, reflectively,
      after they had passed through the bars. &ldquo;My hearin&rsquo; an&rsquo; eyesight is bad,
      an&rsquo; so is my memory of faces, but it seems like I&rsquo;ve seed somebody
      some&rsquo;r&rsquo;s that favors you mightily.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He walked on silently. Only the little corn-patch was between them and the
      group in the yard. He could hear Sanders&rsquo;s drawling voice, and caught a
      gleam of the kitchen fire through the alder-bushes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You better le&rsquo; me take the bucket,&rdquo; she said, stopping abruptly and
      showing some embarrassment. &ldquo;Yo&rsquo; &lsquo;re mighty gentlemanly; but Alf&rsquo;s wife
      al&rsquo;ays gits mad when I make at all free with company. The whole family
      pokes fun at me, an&rsquo; &lsquo;lows I am childish, an&rsquo; too fond o&rsquo; talkin&rsquo;. They
      expect me jest to keep my mouth shet an&rsquo; never have a word to say. It
      cayn&rsquo;t be helped, I reckon, but it&rsquo;s a awful way fer a old body to live.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a fact!&rdquo; he blurted out, impulsively, still holding to the pail,
      on which she had put her hand. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the last place on earth fer you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hain&rsquo;t had one single day o&rsquo; enjoyment sence I came here,&rdquo; she
      continued, encouraged to talk by his manifest sympathy. &ldquo;I reckon I ort to
      be thankful, an&rsquo; beggars mustn&rsquo;t be choosers, as the feller said; fer no
      other family in the county would take me in. But it hain&rsquo;t no place fer a
      old woman that likes peace an&rsquo; rest at my time o&rsquo; life. I work hard all
      day, an&rsquo; at night I need sound sleep; but they put the children in my bed,
      an&rsquo; they keep up a kickin&rsquo; an&rsquo; a squirmin&rsquo; all night. Then, the&rsquo; ain&rsquo;t no
      other old women round here, an&rsquo; I git mighty lonesome. Sometimes I come as
      nigh as pease givin&rsquo; up entirely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank the Lord, you won&rsquo;t have to stand it any longer!&rdquo; he exclaimed,
      hotly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She started from him in astonishment, and began to study his features. At
      that juncture two of Sanders&rsquo;s little girls drew near inquisitively.
      &ldquo;Here!&rdquo; and he held the pail out to them. &ldquo;Take this milk to yore mammy.&rdquo;
       One of them, half frightened, took the pail, and both scampered back to
      the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yo&rsquo; &lsquo;re a curi&rsquo;s sort of a man,&rdquo; she said, with a serious kind of
      chuckle, as she drew her shawl up over her white head. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t &lsquo;a&rsquo;
      done that fer a dollar. You skeered Sally out &rsquo;n a year&rsquo;s growth. I used
      to have a boy, that went away West ten year ago, who used to fly up like
      you do, an&rsquo; you sorter put me in mind of him, you do. He was the best one
      I had. I could allus count on him fer help. He was as steady-goin&rsquo; as a
      clock. He never was heerd from, an&rsquo; the general belief is that he died out
      thar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a moment&rsquo;s pause. He seemed trying to think of some way to
      reveal his identity. &ldquo;You ortn&rsquo;t to pay attention to everything you hear,&rdquo;
       he ventured, awkwardly. &ldquo;Who knows? Mebby he&rsquo;s still alive&mdash;sech
      things ain&rsquo;t so almighty oncommon. Seems like I&rsquo;ve heerd tell o&rsquo; a feller
      named Bradley out thar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon it wasn&rsquo;t Jim,&rdquo; she sighed. &ldquo;It was my daily prayer fer a long
      time that he mought come back, but thar ain&rsquo;t no sech luck fer me. I&rsquo;ve
      done give up. I am a destitute, lonely woman, an&rsquo; I cayn&rsquo;t stan&rsquo; all this
      commotion an&rsquo; wrangle much longer. Ef I had him to work fer now, I
      wouldn&rsquo;t keer; I&rsquo;d wear my fingers to the bone; but fer people that ain&rsquo;t
      no speck o&rsquo; kin an&rsquo; hain&rsquo;t no appreciation fer what a body does it&rsquo;s
      different.&rdquo; The corners of her mouth were drawn down, and she put her thin
      hand up to her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t b&rsquo;lieve you&rsquo;d know &rsquo;im ef you was to see &lsquo;im,&rdquo; he said, laughing
      artificially and taking her hand in his.
    </p>
    <p>
      She started. A shiver ran through her frame, and her fingers clutched his
      convulsively. &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; she gasped. &ldquo;Oh, my Lord, what does the
      man mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The&rsquo; ain&rsquo;t much doubt in my mind that he&rsquo;s alive an&rsquo; ort to have a
      thousand lashes on his bare back fer neglectin&rsquo; his old mammy,&rdquo; he said,
      trying to hide the tremor in his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      A startled light of recognition dawned in her eyes and illumined her whole
      visage. She stared at him with dilating eyes for an instant, and then fell
      into his arms. &ldquo;Oh, Jim, I declare I cayn&rsquo;t stan&rsquo; it! It will kill me! It
      will kill me!&rdquo; she cried, putting her arms about his neck and drawing his
      head down to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m as glad as you are, mother,&rdquo; he replied, tenderly stroking her white
      hair with his rough hand; &ldquo;no feller livin&rsquo; ever wanted to see his mammy
      wuss.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then there seemed nothing further for either of them to say, and so he led
      her on to the house and to the chair he had left a few moments before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve let the cat out &rsquo;n the bag,&rdquo; he said, shamefacedly, answering their
      glances of inquiry. &ldquo;I had to mighty nigh tell her point-blank who I was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never &lsquo;lowed I&rsquo;d see &rsquo;im ag&rsquo;in,&rdquo; Mrs. Bradley faltered, in a low,
      tearful tone. &ldquo;I am that thankful my heavenly Father let me live to this
      day. I&rsquo;d suffer it all over an&rsquo; over ag&rsquo;in fer this joy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sanders was silent, and his wife; and the children, barelegged and
      dirty-faced, sat on the grass and mutely watched the bearded stranger and
      his mother in childish wonder. Bradley said nothing, but he moved his
      chair nearer to his mother&rsquo;s and put his strong arm around her. Sanders
      broke the silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have you been follerin&rsquo;, Bradley?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sellin&rsquo; goods.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Clerkin&rsquo; fer somebody?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; had a &lsquo;stablishment o&rsquo; my own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t say!&rdquo; and Sanders looked at Bradley&rsquo;s seedy attire and then at
      his wife significantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I made some money out thar. The night &lsquo;fore I left, a feller offered
      me ten thousand dollars in cash fer my stock o&rsquo; goods, an&rsquo; I tuk &rsquo;im up. I
      didn&rsquo;t wait to put on my Sunday clothes; these is the things I worked in,
      handlin&rsquo; dirty groceries. I hain&rsquo;t the pertic&rsquo;lar sort. I&rsquo;ve got some
      bonds an&rsquo; rale estate that kin remain jest as well whar they are at
      present. I&rsquo;ve come back here to stay with mother. I couldn&rsquo;t stand it to
      be alone much longer, an&rsquo; I wouldn&rsquo;t ax &rsquo;er to move to a new country at
      &rsquo;er age.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sanders and his wife stared at him in astonishment. Mrs. Bradley leaned
      forward and looked intently into his face. She was very pale and quivered
      with new excitement, but she said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My Lord, you&rsquo;ve had luck!&rdquo; exclaimed Sanders, thinking of something to
      say finally. &ldquo;What on earth are you gwine to invest in here, ef it hain&rsquo;t
      no harm to ax?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I &lsquo;lowed I&rsquo;d buy a big plantation. They are a-goin&rsquo; cheap these times, I
      reckon. I want a place whar a livin&rsquo; will come easy, an&rsquo; whar I kin make
      mother comfortable. She&rsquo;s too old to have to lay &rsquo;er hand to a thing, ur
      be bothered in the least. I want to be nigh some meetin&rsquo;-house of her
      persuasion, an whar she kin &lsquo;sociate with other women o&rsquo; her age. I don&rsquo;t
      expect to atone fer my neglect, but I intend to try my hand at it fer a
      change.&rdquo; Mrs. Bradley lowered her head to her son&rsquo;s knee, and began to sob
      softly. Then Mrs. Sanders got up quickly. &ldquo;I smell my bread a-burnin&rsquo;,&rdquo;
       she said. &ldquo;I &rsquo;ll call y&rsquo;all into supper directly. We hain&rsquo;t pretendin&rsquo;
      folks, Mr. Bradley, but yo&rsquo; &lsquo;re welcome to what we got. You needn&rsquo;t rise,
      Mrs. Bradley; I kin fix the table.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      THE SALE OF UNCLE RASTUS
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>unt Milly&rsquo;s cabin
      was brightly illuminated. Crude tallow dips in the necks of cracked jugs
      and bottles spangled a dark clothless table, a slanting heap of blazing
      logs filled the wide rock-and-mud chimney, and a bonfire of pine knots at
      the &ldquo;wash-place&rdquo; near the door outside threw a red light far down the road
      which led past a row of cabins to the residence of Aunt Milly&rsquo;s owner, Mr.
      Herbert Putnam.
    </p>
    <p>
      The season&rsquo;s crop of corn had been hauled up from the fields to the cribs.
      Frost had come; persimmons were ripe, and Aunt Milly was going to give the
      first opossum supper of the fall. Her two boys, Len and CÃ¦sar, had caught
      two fat opossums the night before, and she had dressed the game and left
      it in a couple of pans out on the roof&mdash;&ldquo;ter let de fros&rsquo; bite de
      wil&rsquo; taste out &rsquo;n it en tender it up &lsquo;fo&rsquo; bilin&rsquo; en bakin&rsquo;.&rdquo; She had given
      this explanation to her husband, Uncle Rastus, who had been irritated by
      her rising two or three times in the night &ldquo;ter see ef dem cats wuzn&rsquo;t
      atter dat meat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Uncle Rastus was sick; he had taken a severe cold, which had settled on
      his lungs and given him a cough. Hearing the negroes singing as they came
      through the fields from the neighboring plantations, he left his bed in
      the lean-to shed and hobbled slowly into the glare of candlelight. He
      sniffed the aroma of coffee and baked meat and intently surveyed the
      preparations his wife had made.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heer um&mdash;dat Nelse&rsquo;s tenor en Montague&rsquo;s bass; dey all comin&rsquo;. I
      never heer sech er racket!&rdquo; As he spoke he put a quilt down on the floor
      in the chimney-corner and lay down and pushed out his long bare feet to
      the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon I got my heerin&rsquo;,&rdquo; she replied, eying him reprovingly. &ldquo;Look
      a-heer, Rastus, who seh you might git up? You know you gwine hat er wuss
      achin&rsquo; dan ever in yo&rsquo; ches&rsquo; ef you lie dar over dem cracks des atter you
      got out &rsquo;n dat warm bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lemme &lsquo;lone,&rdquo; he said, in an offhand tone; &ldquo;you reckon I ain&rsquo;t gwine be
      at yo&rsquo; &rsquo;possum supper, en mebby it de las&rsquo; night on dis yer plantation&mdash;huh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His words evoked no reply, for the guests were now near the door, and she
      had advanced to meet them. Nelse and Montague, two tall, lank negroes,
      slouched in and dropped their hats on the floor. They were followed by
      Aunt Winnie and her husband and a crowd of negroes of all ages and sizes.
      As the guests filed in at the door and huddled round the fire and Rastus&rsquo;s
      perpendicular feet, each put a silver quarter into a bowl on the end of
      the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t &lsquo;grudge you mine, Aunt Milly,&rdquo; said Aunt Winnie, feelingly. &ldquo;My
      goodness, you is hat ernough trouble, wid yo&rsquo; marster bein&rsquo; so po&rsquo; en Une&rsquo;
      Rastus so sickly en y&rsquo;all gwine be put up on de auction-block ter-morrer
      en no idee whar you gwine nex&rsquo;. How much y&rsquo; reckin you gwine ter fetch,
      Aunt Milly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For reply Aunt Milly simply shrugged her fat shoulders as she went round
      among her guests and took their bonnets and shawls, which she piled
      promiscuously on a chest in the corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s wuff all she &rsquo;ll bring, I boun&rsquo; yer,&rdquo; said Nelse, who was standing
      almost astride of Rastus&rsquo;s head. &ldquo;As for me, Aunt Milly, I&rsquo;d er sight
      ruther be put up on de auction-block at de court-house dan ter be sol&rsquo; in
      er slave-mart. Dey hat me on sale in New Orleans fur two weeks han&rsquo;
      runnin&rsquo;, settin&rsquo; bolt up in er long room wid er passel er niggers dey call
      Cre-owls, en people constant er-lookin&rsquo; at me en axin&rsquo; my price. Dey feed
      you on de fat er de lan&rsquo; en keep you dressed up, but you never know is yer
      gwine ter be er ditch-digger ur somebody&rsquo;s ca&rsquo;ge-driver. On de block it
      soon over en you know whar you gwine, en ef er nigger is sharp he kin
      manage er li&rsquo;l en git on de good side er some white man he likes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marse Geo&rsquo;ge Putnam &rsquo;ll buy y&rsquo;all, you know he will,&rdquo; remarked Aunt
      Winnie to Ras-tus, who had sat up on his quilt and been listening eagerly
      to Nelse. &ldquo;He &rsquo;ll be on&rsquo;y too glad er de chance ter spite Marse Herbert en
      rake in some mo&rsquo; uv his paw&rsquo;s old slaves. He already bought up all de lan&rsquo;
      &lsquo;cep&rsquo; de li&rsquo;l patch Marse Herbert&rsquo;s house stan&rsquo; on, en now de house en dis
      yer fambly er niggers is all dat is lef&rsquo; fer &rsquo;im ter want. My white folks
      seh ten yeer ergo dat Marse Geo&rsquo;ge never will res&rsquo; satisfied till his po&rsquo;
      brother is flat on his back destitute. Seem lak he in his glory when he
      hear dat suppen o&rsquo; Marse Herbert&rsquo;s is up fer sale, so he kin buy it in. I
      hain&rsquo;t never seed two sech brothers; dey hain&rsquo;t &lsquo;change one word in ten
      yeer; en all kase ole Marse Putnam lef&rsquo; Marse Herbert de ol&rsquo; home place en
      want &rsquo;im ter hol&rsquo; on ter it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Uncle Rastus looked up suddenly. His face was full of angles, and his dark
      eyes flashed in the firelight. &ldquo;I hope he won&rsquo;t buy me,&rdquo; he grunted; &ldquo;ef I
      cayn&rsquo;t stay wid Marse Herbert, de younges&rsquo; en po&rsquo;es&rsquo; er ol&rsquo; marster&rsquo;s
      chillun, I want ter go clean off &rsquo;mongst strangers. Dis <i>me</i>
      er-talkin&rsquo;!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The pathos of this remark struck most of the listeners; but Montague, who,
      for reasons of his own, disliked old Rastus, was unmoved by it. &ldquo;You
      needn&rsquo;t trouble &rsquo;bout whar <i>you</i> gwine,&rdquo; he said, with contemptuous
      emphasis on the &ldquo;you,&rdquo; and he pushed a little black girl to one side that
      he might watch the effect of his words on Rastus. &ldquo;De won&rsquo;t be any big
      scramblin&rsquo; atter you; who want ter buy er nigger des ter git ter bury &lsquo;im
      dese hard times?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be ershamed, Montague,&rdquo; remonstrated Aunt Winnie; &ldquo;be ershamed er
      yo&rsquo;se&rsquo;f!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He ain&rsquo;t got no raisin&rsquo;!&rdquo; blurted out Aunt Milly. &ldquo;Unc&rsquo; Rastus ain&rsquo;t
      gwine ter listen ter dat black fool.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I des know what white folks seh, dat&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; insinuated Montague,
      sullenly. &ldquo;Marse Herbert come over ter see my marster ter-day, en I heerd
      um talkin&rsquo; in de stable-yard. Marse Herbert &rsquo;low he&rsquo;d been countin&rsquo; on
      payin&rsquo; off his pressin&rsquo; debt wid whut dis fambly er niggers would fetch,
      en&rsquo;d laid his plans ter hol&rsquo; on ter his house en go Wes&rsquo; en mek money ter
      pay de in<i>trust</i> en lif&rsquo; de mortgage, but des den Une&rsquo; Rastus, de
      mos&rsquo; valuables&rsquo; one, tuk sick, en now Aunt Milly an&rsquo; de chillun won&rsquo;t
      fetch ernough ter do much good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This announcement produced an impression. Aunt Milly was plainly too much
      astonished even to protest against the brutality of the revelation. Rastus
      took a fresh hold on his thin knees with his arms, coughed deeply and
      painfully, and looked Montague straight in the eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is you tellin&rsquo; de trufe?&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;<i>Is</i> you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hain&rsquo;t no reason to tell you er lie, Unc&rsquo; Rastus.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      From that moment Montague had the contempt of the whole room. Aunt Milly
      was evidently recompensed by this, for she simply looked into the
      sympathetic faces around her and made no sound. Rastus lay back on his
      quilt silently, and languidly thrust his feet back to the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Milly&rsquo;s voice sounded cold and equivocal in her effort to smother her
      emotions when she said, &ldquo;Well, come on, y&rsquo;all, an&rsquo; git yo&rsquo; &rsquo;possum an&rsquo;
      biscuit &lsquo;fo&rsquo; dey git co&rsquo;.&rdquo; The last words of her invitation were drowned
      in the scrambling and shuffling of feet as the crowd surged toward the
      table. A whole opossum embedded in a great heap of fried sweet potatoes
      was placed by Len and CÃ¦sar on each end of the long table, and Aunt Milly
      followed them with a great bucket of coffee and pans of smoking biscuits.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were all seated and had begun the feast, when, to their astonishment,
      Rastus rose and staggered to a vacant place at the end of the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whar my &lsquo;possum, Aunt Milly?&rdquo; he demanded, with pretended pique. &ldquo;On my
      soul, I b&rsquo;lieve you tryin&rsquo; ter lef&rsquo; me out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go back ter yo&rsquo; bed, Rastus,&rdquo; she scolded, gently. &ldquo;What kin got in you?
      you ain&rsquo;t eat nothin&rsquo; in er mont&rsquo; &lsquo;cep&rsquo; er li&rsquo;l soup en gravy, en now you
      want ter founder yo&rsquo;se&rsquo;f on &rsquo;possum meat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He shoved his plate impatiently toward her. &ldquo;Gimme some er dem taters en
      dat &lsquo;possum. You heer me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You too sick, Rastus,&rdquo; protested Aunt Milly, with maternal
      persuasiveness. &ldquo;Go lie down, en I &rsquo;ll fix you some er yo&rsquo; good soup.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know I <i>wuz</i> sick,&rdquo; he replied; &ldquo;but I want ter tell y&rsquo;all, I
      ain&rsquo;t now; I&rsquo;m cuored well en soun&rsquo;.&rdquo; As he spoke these words, accompanied
      by a heroic attempt to hold himself erect in his chair, Aunt Milly
      recalled the strange look of desperate determination that had possessed
      his face when Montague had finished speaking, and she kept silent. Both
      sides of the long table were curiously looking at the invalid. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m er
      li&rsquo;l weak yit, but I ain&rsquo;t sick,&rdquo; he went on, bracing himself with a thin
      hand on each side of the table. &ldquo;You know dat conjure doctor on de river
      plantation? Well, he come by here dis mawnin&rsquo; &lsquo;fo&rsquo; day, he did&mdash;des
      ez I wuz gittin&rsquo; up ter git er armful er firewood, en&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you know dat ain&rsquo;t so, Unc&rsquo; Ras-tus,&rdquo; broke in Aunt Milly, &ldquo;kase I
      got up fus&rsquo; dis mawnin&rsquo;, en you wuz soun&rsquo; ersleep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Twuz long &lsquo;fo&rsquo; you got up, Aunt Milly,&rdquo; added the old man, glibly, as he
      warmed up to his fiction. &ldquo;Well, dat conjure doctor rode by de do&rsquo; on er
      white hoss, he did, en seh to me, &lsquo;Rastus, you sick, en you mus&rsquo; git well
      &lsquo;fo&rsquo; yo&rsquo; marster puts you up for sale, so you kin bring what you is wuff
      ter he&rsquo;p him out &rsquo;n his scrape.&rsquo; En he up en ax me has I my rabbit-foot
      erbout me, en I tuk it out &rsquo;n my weskit pocket, en he seh, &lsquo;Well, put it
      in de hot ashes in de back er de chimbly tell you hear er dog bark, en den
      tek it out en wash it clean in spring-water, en den keep it by you night
      en day,&rsquo; en when I done ez he tol&rsquo; me I got well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A chorus of wondering ejaculations rose from the superstitious listeners,
      and for a moment opossum meat and potatoes were forgotten. Aunt Milly
      looked at her husband tenderly. &ldquo;Dat nigger would die fer Marse Herbert,&rdquo;
       she thought. &ldquo;He dat sick now he cayn&rsquo;t hol&rsquo; his haid up; de sight er dat
      &rsquo;possum meat is gaggin&rsquo; &lsquo;im, but he &rsquo;ll kill me ef I let on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want yo&rsquo; ol&rsquo; &rsquo;possum meat,&rdquo; said Rastus, rising and moving back
      to the fire. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m gwine ter lie down an&rsquo; git rested up fer ter-morrer. Ef
      dey &rsquo;ll let me, I &rsquo;ll dance er breakdown on dat auction-block en turn one
      er my han&rsquo;-springs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He certny is cuored,&rdquo; said Aunt Winnie, gladly. &ldquo;Dese conjure doctors
      beat de ol&rsquo; sort all ter pieces.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The supper over, Aunt Milly slowly counted out her earnings and put them
      away; the table was moved back against the wall; Nelse got out his bones
      and began to play, and Len and CÃ¦sar danced jigs till they sank to the
      floor in exhaustion. After this, plantation songs were sung, ghost-stories
      were told, and it was late when they went back to their homes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following day was a fine one. The air was bracing, and the sun shone
      brightly. The autumnal foliage had never appeared more beautiful; every
      color in nature seemed lavished on the hills near by, and the mountains,
      twenty miles away, blue as the skies in spring and summer, had faded into
      a beautiful pink.
    </p>
    <p>
      The court-house and auction-block were in a village two miles from the
      plantations of the two Putnam brothers. Uncle Rastus and his family were
      sent over in the wagon of Herbert Putnam&rsquo;s overseer, and Lawyer Sill came
      by in his buggy and drove Herbert to the sale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought I would stay away and let you attend to it for me,&rdquo; said
      Herbert Putnam; &ldquo;but my daughter thinks I ought to go. Brother George will
      be there to bid them in. He wouldn&rsquo;t miss the opportunity to humiliate me
      again for anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ought to be on hand,&rdquo; replied Sill, as the other got into the buggy.
      &ldquo;Your negroes worship you, and would feel hurt if you were not present.
      Your brother has acted very badly, and has made himself unpopular by it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was my father&rsquo;s wish that I hold the home place, but George never
      could forgive me for it. If he had advanced money to me, as he has to
      total strangers, I should have paid out all right. He has a better head
      for business than I have.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A hundred wagons, buggies, and carriages were scattered over the
      court-house common, the hitching-racks were hidden by mules and horses,
      and a considerable crowd of people, white and black, were clustered around
      the auction-block to the right of the court-house door, near the massive
      log jail. In the edge of the crowd an old darky was selling &ldquo;ground-peas,&rdquo;
       and his white-headed wife was threading her way through the crowd,
      retailing hot gingerbread from a basket and fresh cider from a capacious
      jug with a corncob stopper. In some of the carriages elegantly dressed
      ladies sat; young men, the gallants among the gentry of the county, with
      broad hats, and trousers in their bootlegs, conversed with them from the
      backs of restive mettlesome horses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Colonel George Putnam sat in his carriage with his wife and son, but when
      his brother drove up with Lawyer Sill, he alighted and approached his own
      lawyer, who was talking with a group of planters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Burton,&rdquo; said he, in a low tone, &ldquo;remember, you are to bid for me; I
      don&rsquo;t want to be conspicuous, but I will have those negroes. I don&rsquo;t want
      any of my father&rsquo;s estate to go into the hands of strangers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; replied Burton; &ldquo;we won&rsquo;t have much trouble. Old man Staley
      has thrown out some intimation that he intends to do some bidding, but
      he&rsquo;s afraid of his shadow, and when he sees you are in the fight he &lsquo;ll
      draw in his horns.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so. Staley is no friend of mine, and will try to run the
      price up on me out of spite. I looked over them a while ago as they came
      up,&rdquo; the colonel went on, glancing at the wagon in which Uncle Rastus and
      his wife and sons were seated. &ldquo;They all seem in pretty fair condition
      except Rastus. He says he has had a little spell of fever, but that he is
      all right now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is thin, but as sound as a dollar,&rdquo; said Burton, lightly. &ldquo;He jumped
      out of the wagon just now as nimbly as a kitten and unhitched the mules in
      a hurry. I told him I heard he had been sick, and he laughed and said he
      could do more work than ten ordinary darkies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, keep your eye on Staley. My brother has wasted everything my father
      left him, and I owe it to our name to retain as many of our old slaves as
      I can. You told me you would find out the amount of the mortgage on the
      old place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;McPherson lent him five thousand on it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he expects to make that out West and keep the interest paid! He &lsquo;ll
      never do it in the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Burton glanced across the crowd at the seedy-looking man with the pale
      face and iron-gray hair, and his reply was tinged with feeling:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You &lsquo;re purty hard on &lsquo;im, colonel; it&rsquo;s none o&rsquo; my business, but he&rsquo;s a
      powerful good fellow. Seems to me, as he was the only brother you have,
      you might have helped him a little.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The planter&rsquo;s eye fell, and an angry flush came into his dark face. &ldquo;You
      don&rsquo;t know anything about it, Burton,&rdquo; said he, quickly. &ldquo;I acknowledge we
      had some words about the will, but he set afloat the rumors about my
      treatment of him when I was a candidate for the legislature, and it was
      through him that I was beaten.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Burton wished to change the subject. &ldquo;I see the auctioneer and the negroes
      going to the block,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Look at old Rastus; he prances around like
      a two-year-old colt. I reckon you can fatten him up; a little sickness
      does &rsquo;em good sometimes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The crowd drew closer round the platform upon which the red-faced
      auctioneer had sprung and was placing chairs for Rastus and his family.
      All of them except Rastus himself seemed awed by the solemnity of the
      occasion. &ldquo;Who gwine buy me?&rdquo; he laughed, clapping his hands and rubbing
      them together. &ldquo;I been er li&rsquo;l sick, but I&rsquo;m pickin&rsquo; up now, en kin hol&rsquo;
      my own wid any nigger in dis county. Who want me? Speak up quick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dry up,&rdquo; laughed the auctioneer, and he playfully jerked off the old
      man&rsquo;s hat and laid it in the latter&rsquo;s lap. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know ernough not to
      come &lsquo;fo&rsquo; company with yore hat on? Who&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to sell this batch of
      niggers, you or me? Ef you are, I &rsquo;ll git down and bid on you. I want
      somebody to look after my thoroughbreds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This sally evoked a wave of laughter from the crowd, and Rastus joined in
      with as much enjoyment as if he had caused it. Herbert Putnam drew Sill
      aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rastus is shamming,&rdquo; he whispered; &ldquo;he is as sick as he can be right now.
      He&rsquo;s doing it in order to bring a better price, to help me out. Dr. Wilson
      said the other day that he might live to be an old man, but that he&rsquo;d
      never be able to work any more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good gracious!&rdquo; ejaculated Sill; &ldquo;who ever heard the like? He&rsquo;s a hero.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Herbert Putnam&rsquo;s eyes glistened and his voice was unsteady as he spoke.
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d give my right arm rather than part with him. If I were able, he and
      his should be free to-day.&rdquo; The auctioneer began to gesticulate and shout:
      &ldquo;Six hundred has been bid on Rastus, by Mr. Burton over thar, to start the
      game. Only six hundred for one of the best buck negroes in the county.
      Seven hundred! That&rsquo;s right, Mr. Staley; he&rsquo;s the very man you want. Seven
      hundred; eight do I hear it? Thank you; Mr. Burton don&rsquo;t intend to take a
      back seat. All right; nine hundred! Nine-fifty do I hear it, Mr. Burton?
      Nine-fifty it is. Mr. Staley has got a thousand ready for him; a thousand
      has been bid; anybody else in the fight? Old Rastus is thin, but he could
      throw a bull a rod by the tail. One thousand only on a two-thousand-dollar
      negro. Do I hear more?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      George Putnam&rsquo;s face darkened angrily as he watched the excited features
      of old man Staley. He drew Burton&rsquo;s ear down to his lips: &ldquo;Bid twelve
      hundred, and knock him out and be done with it,&rdquo; he whispered; &ldquo;it will
      scare him to death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twelve hundred,&rdquo; said Burton, without a change of countenance, and
      silence fell on the chattering, speculating crowd; even the voluble
      auctioneer showed surprise by not at once echoing the bid. Old Rastus took
      advantage of the pause; he sprang up and clapped his hands and knocked his
      heels together. &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t no thousand-dollar nigger,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I b&rsquo;longs
      ter Marse Herbert Putnam, I does; de ain&rsquo;t no cheap nigger on dis yer
      block.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twelve hundred dollars!&rdquo; repeated the auctioneer, impressively, and there
      was something vaguely respectful in the way he pushed Rastus back into his
      chair. &ldquo;Twelve hundred! Mr. Staley, don&rsquo;t back out; you need &rsquo;im wuss than
      anybody else. Is it twelve-twenty-five?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Staley hesitated; his eyes fell before the concentrated stare of the
      silent crowd, and then he nodded. A murmur passed through the assembly,
      and Colonel Putnam grew white with anger. &ldquo;Some one has put him up to
      this,&rdquo; he said in a low tone to his agent. &ldquo;Make it thirteen hundred.&rdquo; And
      the next instant the auctioneer was flaunting the bid in the face of old
      Staley.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert Putnam, unnoticed by any one, elbowed his way through the crowd to
      his brother and touched him on the arm. Their eyes met. &ldquo;Pardon me,&rdquo; said
      Herbert, &ldquo;but I must speak to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And George Putnam was drawn beyond the outskirts of the crowd. &ldquo;I cannot
      keep quiet and see you cheated,&rdquo; faltered Herbert, with his eyes averted.
      &ldquo;A long time ago, when you and I were boys, you stood up for me, and I
      cannot forget that we are brothers. Don&rsquo;t bid any more on Rastus; he is
      shamming; he is as sick as he can be, and is only pretending to be well to
      bring a high price.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two men gazed into each other&rsquo;s eyes. George Putnam was quivering all
      over, and his face was softening. Impulsively he put out his hand, as if
      to apologize for his lack of words. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s not be enemies any longer,&rdquo;
       went on Herbert, as he pressed the extended hand. &ldquo;I am sick and tired of
      this estrangement. I am going away, and I may never come back. I can&rsquo;t
      keep up the old place as father thought I would, and you are welcome to
      it. Take it and care for it; mother&rsquo;s and father&rsquo;s graves are on it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      George Putnam&rsquo;s face was working; he strove to reply, but his voice
      clogged. He looked toward his son and wife in his carriage, and then back
      into his brother&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;God forgive me, Herb,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve treated
      you like a dog. Old Rastus has been truer to you than your own brother.
      You shall not give up the old place; you must keep it. Wait!&rdquo; And with
      those words he hurried to the platform.
    </p>
    <p>
      The auctioneer had been proclaiming Staley&rsquo;s reckless bid of
      thirteen-twenty-five, and the crowd was eagerly taking in the unusual
      sight of the two Putnam brothers in close conversation. Colonel Putnam
      reached the platform and signed the auctioneer to be quiet. Standing on
      the lower step, he was in the view of all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want Rastus, and I am going to have him,&rdquo; he said to the upturned
      faces. &ldquo;I want him to give him back to my brother, who has been forced by
      my neglect to offer him for sale. Twenty thousand dollars is my bid&mdash;and
      Rastus is worth every cent of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No one spoke as Colonel Putnam stepped back into the crowd. Old Rastus
      seemed the only one to thoroughly grasp the situation. &ldquo;Bress de Lawd!&rdquo; he
      exclaimed, and he slapped Aunt Milly on the back. &ldquo;Dem boys done made up,
      en I fotch twenty thousand dollars! Whooee!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twenty thousand dollars,&rdquo; said the auctioneer, awkwardly. &ldquo;Twenty
      thousand&mdash;do I hear&mdash;and sold to Colonel Putnam. I reckon the&rsquo;
      ain&rsquo;t no use puttin&rsquo; up the others.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was great activity in the crowd. Everybody was trying to see the two
      brothers as they went arm in arm to Colonel Putnam&rsquo;s carriage, and a
      moment later, when the vehicle with four occupants turned into the road
      leading toward George Putnam&rsquo;s plantation, a unanimous cheer rose from the
      crowd.

    <h2>
      THE CONVICT&rsquo;S RETURN
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he pedestrian
      trudged down the tortuous declivitous road of the mountain amidst the
      splendor of autumn-tinted leafage and occasional dashes of rhododendron
      flowers. Now and then he would stop and deeply breathe in the crisp air,
      as if it were a palpable substance which was pleasing to his palate. At
      such moments, when the interstices of trunks and bowlders would permit,
      his eyes, large with weariness, would rest on a certain farmhouse in the
      valley below.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s identical the same,&rdquo; he said, when he had completed the descent of
      the mountain and was drawing near to it. &ldquo;As fer as I can make out, it
      hain&rsquo;t altered one bit sence the day they tuk me away. Ef ever&rsquo;thing seems
      purtier now, it may be beca&rsquo;se it&rsquo;s in the fall of the year an&rsquo; the
      maple-trees an&rsquo; the laurel look so fancy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Approaching the barn, the only appurtenance to the four-roomed house,
      farther on by a hundred yards, he leaned on the rail fence and looked over
      into the barnyard at the screw of blue smoke which was rising from a fire
      under a huge iron boiler.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marty&rsquo;s killin&rsquo; hogs,&rdquo; he said, reflectively. &ldquo;I mought &lsquo;a&rsquo; picked a
      better day fer gittin&rsquo; back; she never was knowed to be in a good humor
      durin&rsquo; hog-killin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He half climbed, half vaulted over the fence, and approached the woman,
      who was bowed over an improvised table of undressed planks on which were
      heaped the dismembered sides, shoulders, and hams of pork. His heart was
      in his mouth, owing to the carking doubt as to his welcome which had been
      oozing into the joy of freedom ever since he began his homeward journey.
      But it was not his wife who looked up as his step rustled the corn-husks
      near her, but her unmarried sister, Lucinda Dykes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I never!&rdquo; she ejaculated. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Dick Wakeman, as I am alive!&rdquo; She
      wiped her hand on her apron and gave it to him, limp and cold. &ldquo;We all
      heerd you was pardoned out, but none of us &lsquo;lowed you&rsquo;d make so straight
      fer home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His features shrank, as if battered by the blow she had unwittingly dealt
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say!&rdquo; he grunted. &ldquo;Whar else in the name o&rsquo; common sense would a feller
      go? A body that&rsquo;s been penned up in the penitentiary fer four years don&rsquo;t
      keer to be losin&rsquo; time monkeyin&rsquo; round amongst plumb strangers, when his
      own folks&mdash;when he hain&rsquo;t laid eyes on his&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But, after all, good reasons for his haste in returning could not be found
      outside of a certain sentimentality which lay deep beneath Wakeman&rsquo;s
      rugged exterior, and to which no one had ever heard him refer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shorely,&rdquo; said the old maid, taking a wrong grasp of the situation&mdash;&ldquo;shorely
      you knowed, Dick, that Marty has got &rsquo;er divorce?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes. Bad news takes a bee-line shoot fer its mark. I heerd the court
      had granted &rsquo;er a release, but that don&rsquo;t matter. A lawyer down thar told
      me that it all could be fixed up now I&rsquo;m out. Ef I&rsquo;d &lsquo;a&rsquo; been at home,
      Marty never would &lsquo;a&rsquo; made sech a goose of &lsquo;erse&rsquo;f. How much did the
      divorce set &rsquo;er back?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About a hundred dollars,&rdquo; answered Lucinda.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Money liter&rsquo;ly throwed away,&rdquo; said the convict, with irrepressible
      indignation. &ldquo;Marty never did quite sech a silly thing while I was at
      home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old maid stared at him, a half-amused smile playing over her thin
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it was her money,&rdquo; she said, argumentatively. &ldquo;She owned the farm an&rsquo;
      every stick an&rsquo; head o&rsquo; stock on it when you an&rsquo; &rsquo;er got married.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t tell me that,&rdquo; said Wakeman, sharply. &ldquo;I know that; but that
      ain&rsquo;t no reason fer &rsquo;er to throw &rsquo;er money away gittin&rsquo; a divorce.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lucinda filled her hand with salt and began to sprinkle it on a side of
      meat. &ldquo;Law me,&rdquo; she tittered, &ldquo;I &rsquo;ll bet you hain&rsquo;t heerd about Marty an&rsquo;
      Jeff Goardley.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I have. Meddlin&rsquo; busybodies has writ me about that, too,&rdquo; said
      Wakeman, sitting down on the hopper of a corn-sheller and idly swinging
      his foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a-courtin&rsquo; of &rsquo;er like a broom-sedge field afire,&rdquo; added the sister,
      tentatively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s got too much sense to marry &rsquo;im after &rsquo;er promises to me,&rdquo; said the
      convict, firmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She lets &rsquo;im come reg&rsquo;lar ev&rsquo;ry Tuesday night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wakeman was not ready with a reply, and Lucinda began to salt another
      piece of pork.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ev&rsquo;ry Tuesday night, rain or shine,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The words released Wakeman&rsquo;s tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huh, he&rsquo;s the most triflin&rsquo; fop in the county.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Looks like some o&rsquo; the neighbors is powerful bent on the match,&rdquo;
       continued Lucinda, her tone betraying her own lack of sympathy for the
      thing in question. &ldquo;Marty was a-standin&rsquo; over thar at the fence jest &lsquo;fore
      you come an&rsquo; whirled all of a sudden an&rsquo; went up to the house. She said
      she was afeered her cracklin&rsquo;s would burn, but I &rsquo;ll bet she seed you down
      the road. I never have been able to make &rsquo;er out. She ain&rsquo;t once mentioned
      yore name sence you went off. Dick, I&rsquo;m one that don&rsquo;t, nur never did,
      believe you meant to steal Williams&rsquo;s hoss, kase you was too drunk to know
      what you was a-doin&rsquo;, but Marty never says whether she does ur doesn&rsquo;t.
      The day the news come back that you was sentenced I ketched &rsquo;er in the
      back room a-cryin&rsquo; as&rsquo; ef &rsquo;er heart would break, but that night &lsquo;Lonzo
      Spann come in an&rsquo; said that you had let it out in the court-room that
      you&rsquo;d be glad even to go to the penitentiary to git a rest from Marty&rsquo;s
      tongue, an&rsquo;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lucinda, as thar&rsquo;s a God on high, them words never passed my lips,&rdquo; the
      convict interrupted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I &lsquo;lowed not,&rdquo; the old maid returned. &ldquo;But it has got to be a sort of
      standin&rsquo; joke ag&rsquo;in Marty, an&rsquo; she heers it ev&rsquo;ry now an&rsquo; then. But I&rsquo;m
      yore friend, Dick. I&rsquo;ve had respect fer you ever sence I noticed how you
      suffered when Annie got sick an&rsquo; died. Thar ain&rsquo;t many men that has sech
      feelin&rsquo; fer their dead children.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wakeman&rsquo;s face softened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was jest a-wonderin&rsquo;, comin&rsquo; on, ef&mdash;ef anybody has been a-lookin&rsquo;
      after the grave sence I went off. The boys in the penitentiary used to
      mention the&rsquo;r dead once in a while, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;d always tell &rsquo;em about my
      grave. Pris &lsquo;ners, Lucinda, git to relyin&rsquo; on the company o&rsquo; the&rsquo;r dead
      about as much as the&rsquo;r livin&rsquo; folks. In the four years that I was in
      confinement not one friend o&rsquo; mine ever come to ax how I was gittin&rsquo; on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marty has been a-lookin&rsquo; after the grave,&rdquo; said Lucinda, in the
      suppressed tone peculiar to people who desire to disown deep emotion. She
      turned her face toward the house. &ldquo;I wish you wouldn&rsquo;t talk about yore
      bein&rsquo; neglected down thar, Dick. The Lord knows I&rsquo;ve laid awake many an&rsquo;
      many a cold night a-wonderin&rsquo; ef they give you-uns enough cover, an&rsquo; ef
      they tuk them cold chains off &rsquo;n you at night. An&rsquo; I reckon Marty did,
      too, fer she used to roll an&rsquo; tumble as ef &rsquo;er mind wasn&rsquo;t at ease.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wakeman took off his coat and rolled up his shirt-sleeves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m itchin&rsquo; to set in to farm-work ag&rsquo;in,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Let me salt fer you,
      an&rsquo; you run up thar an&rsquo; tell &rsquo;er I&rsquo;m back. Maybe she &rsquo;ll come down heer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lucinda gave him her place at the table, a troubled expression taking hold
      of her features.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The great drawback is Jeff Goardley,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It really does look like
      him an&rsquo; Marty will come to a understandin&rsquo;. I don&rsquo;t know railly but what
      she may have promised him; he has seemed mighty confident heer lately.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wakeman shrugged his shoulders and said nothing. He filled his hands with
      the salt from a pail and began to rub it on the pork.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lingeringly the woman left him and turned up the slight incline toward the
      house. His eyes did not follow her. He was scrutinizing the pile of pork
      she had salted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Goodness gracious!&rdquo; he grunted. &ldquo;Lu-cindy has wasted fifteen pound o&rsquo;
      salt. Ef I&rsquo;d &lsquo;a&rsquo; done that Marty&rsquo;d &lsquo;a&rsquo; tuk the top o&rsquo; my head off. I
      wonder ef Marty could &lsquo;a&rsquo; got careless sence she&rsquo;s had all the work to
      look after.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had salted the last piece of meat when, looking up, he saw Lucinda
      standing near him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She wouldn&rsquo;t come a step,&rdquo; she announced, with some awkwardness of
      delivery. &ldquo;When I told &rsquo;er you wuz down heer she jest come to the door an&rsquo;
      looked down at you a-workin&rsquo; an&rsquo; grunted an&rsquo; went back to &rsquo;er cracklin&rsquo;s.
      But that&rsquo;s Marty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The convict dipped his hands into a tub of hot water and wiped them on an
      empty salt-bag.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;ef I&rsquo;d better&mdash;&rdquo; But he proceeded no further.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I would,&rdquo; said the angular mind-reader, sympathetically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you come on up thar, too,&rdquo; Wake-man proposed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always noticed
      that when you are about handy she never has as much to say as she does
      commonly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I &rsquo;ll have to go,&rdquo; said Lucinda. &ldquo;Ef Marty gits to talkin&rsquo; to you she &lsquo;ll
      let the cracklin&rsquo;s burn, an&rsquo; then&mdash;then she&rsquo;d marry Goardley out o&rsquo;
      pure spite.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As the pair reached the steps of the back porch the convict caught a
      glimpse of a gingham skirt within, and its stiff flounce as it vanished
      behind the half-closed door-shutter suddenly flung an aspect of
      seriousness into his countenance. He paused, his foot on the lowest step,
      and peered into the sitting-room. Seeing it empty, he smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I &rsquo;ll go in thar an&rsquo; take a cheer. Tell &rsquo;er I want to see &lsquo;er.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His air of returning self-confidence provoked a faint laugh from his
      well-wisher.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yo&rsquo; &lsquo;re a case,&rdquo; she said, nodding her consent to his request. &ldquo;You are
      different frum &lsquo;most anybody else. Somehow I can&rsquo;t think about you ever
      havin&rsquo; been jailed fer hoss-stealin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It all depends on a body&rsquo;s feelin&rsquo;s,&rdquo; the convict returned. &ldquo;Down thar in
      the penitentiary we had a little gang of us that knowed we wuz innocent of
      wrong intentions, an&rsquo; we kinder flocked together. All the rest sorter
      looked up to us an&rsquo; believed we wuz all right. It was a comfort. I &lsquo;ll
      step in an&rsquo; git it over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He walked as erectly as an Indian up the steps and into the sitting-room.
      To his surprise Mrs. Wakeman started to enter the room from the adjoining
      kitchen, and seeing him, turned and began to beat a hasty retreat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold on thar, Marty,&rdquo; he called out, in the old tone which had formerly
      made strangers suppose that the farm and all pertaining to it had been his
      when he married her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She paused in the doorway, white and sullen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t you a-goin&rsquo; to tell a feller howdy an&rsquo; shake hands?&rdquo; he asked, with
      considerable self-possession.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What &rsquo;ud I do that fur?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beca&rsquo;se I&rsquo;m home ag&rsquo;in,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huh, nobody hain&rsquo;t missed you.&rdquo; The words followed a forced shrug.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know a sight better &rsquo;n that, Marty,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I know a woman that &lsquo;ud
      take a duck fit jest when I was gone to drive the cows home an&rsquo; got
      delayed a little, would fret consider&rsquo;ble durin&rsquo; four years of sech a&mdash;a
      trip as I&rsquo;ve had. Set down here an&rsquo; let&rsquo;s have a talk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got my work to do,&rdquo; she returned, after half a minute of
      speechlessness, her helpless anger standing between her and satisfactory
      expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, all right!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t no hand to waste time durin&rsquo; work
      hours with dillydallyin&rsquo;. Any other time &rsquo;ll do me jest as well. I &lsquo;lowed
      maybe it would suit you better to have it over with. I must git out the
      hoss an&rsquo; wagon an&rsquo; haul that hog-meat up to the smokehouse. Whar&rsquo;s Cato? I
      &rsquo;ll bet that triflin&rsquo; nigger has give you the slip ag&rsquo;in this hog-killin&rsquo;,
      like he always did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Wakeman stared at the speaker in a sort of thwarted, defiant way
      without deigning to reply; her sneer was the only thing about her bearing
      which seemed at all expressive of the vast contempt for him that she
      really did not feel. She felt that her silence was cowardly, her failure
      to assert her rights as a divorced woman an admission that she was glad of
      his return.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this critical juncture Lucinda Dykes sauntered into the room and leaned
      against the dingy, once sky-blue wall. Her air of interested amusement
      over the matrimonial predicament had left her. It had dawned upon her, now
      that her sister had taken refuge in obstinate silence, that a vast
      responsibility rested on her as intermediary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cato went with some more niggers to a shindig over at Squire Camp&rsquo;s
      yesterday an&rsquo; hain&rsquo;t showed up sence,&rdquo; she explained. &ldquo;Ef I was you-uns&mdash;ef
      I was Marty, I mean&mdash;I&rsquo;d turn &rsquo;im off fer good an&rsquo; all. Dick, sence
      you went off me nur Marty hain&rsquo;t been able to do a thing with &lsquo;im.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The convict grunted. It was as if he had succeeded in rolling the last
      four years from his memory as completely as if they had never passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jest wait till I see the black scamp,&rdquo; he growled. &ldquo;I reckon I &rsquo;ll have
      to do every lick of the work myself.&rdquo; With that Wakeman turned into the
      entry and thence went to the stable-yard near by.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He hain&rsquo;t altered a smidgin&rsquo;,&rdquo; Lucinda commented. &ldquo;It may be kase he has
      on the identical same clothes; he&rsquo;s been a-wearin&rsquo; striped ones down thar,
      you know, an&rsquo; they laid away his old ones. To save me I can&rsquo;t realize that
      he&rsquo;s been off even a week.&rdquo; The old maid snickered softly. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s the only
      one that could ever manage you, Marty. Now Jeff Goardley would let you
      have yore own way, but Dick&rsquo;s a caution! It&rsquo;s always been a question with
      me as to whether a woman would ruther lead a man ur be led.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a white stare in Mrs Wakeman&rsquo;s eyes which indicated that she was
      pondering the man&rsquo;s chief aggression rather than heeding her sister&rsquo;s
      nagging remarks. The sudden appearance of the convict&rsquo;s head and shoulders
      above a near-at-hand window-sill rendered a reply unnecessary. His face
      was flushed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you-uns tell me whar under the sun the halter is?&rdquo; he broke forth, in
      a turbulent tone. &ldquo;I tuk the trouble to put a iron hook up in the
      shed-room jest fer that halter, an&rsquo; now somebody has tore down the hook
      an&rsquo; I can&rsquo;t find hair nur hide o&rsquo; the halter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Wakeman tried to sneer again as she turned aside, and the gaunt
      intermediary, spurred on to her duty, approached the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The blacksmith tuk that hook to mend the harrow with,&rdquo; she said, with a
      warning glance at Marty. &ldquo;You &rsquo;ll find the halter on the joist above the
      hoss-trough. Ef I was you, on this fust day, I&rsquo;d try to&mdash;&rdquo; But
      Wakeman had dropped out of sight, and muttering unintelligible sounds
      indicative of discomfiture, was striding toward the stable.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the rest of that afternoon the convict toiled in the smoke-house,
      hanging the meat on hooks along the joists over a slow, partly smothered
      fire of chips and pieces of bark. When the work was finished his eyes were
      red from smoke and brine. He stabled the horse and fed him, and then,
      realizing that he had nothing more to do, he felt hungry. He wanted to go
      into the sitting-room and sit down in his old place in the chimney-corner,
      but a growing appreciation of the extreme delicacy of the situation had
      taken hold of him. He wandered about the stable-yard in a desultory way,
      going to the pig-pen, now empty and blood-stained, and to the well-filled
      corn-crib, but these objects had little claim on his interest. The evening
      shadows had begun to stalk like dank amphibious monsters over the carpet
      of turf along the creek-banks, and pencils of light were streaming out of
      the windows of the family-room. Suddenly his eyes took in the woodpile; he
      went to it, and picking up the ax, began to cut wood. He was tired, but he
      felt that he would rather be seen occupied than remaining outside without
      a visible excuse for so doing. In a few minutes he was joined by Lucinda.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dick,&rdquo; she intoned, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve worked enough, the Lord Almighty knows. Come
      in the house an&rsquo; rest &lsquo;fore supper; it&rsquo;s mighty nigh ready.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He avoided her glance, and shamefacedly touched a big log he had just cut
      into the proper length for the fireplace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cato, the triflin&rsquo; scamp, hain&rsquo;t cut you-uns a single backlog,&rdquo; he said,
      in a tone that she had never heard from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We hain&rsquo;t had a decent one sence you went off, Brother Richard,&rdquo; she
      returned. &ldquo;An&rsquo; a fire&rsquo;s no fire without a backlog.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Their eyes met. She saw that he was deeply stirred by her tenderness, and
      that opened the floodgates of her sympathy. She began to rub her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Dick, I&rsquo;m so miser&rsquo;ble; ef you an&rsquo; Marty don&rsquo;t quit actin&rsquo; like you
      are I don&rsquo;t know what I will do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She saw him make a motion as if he had swallowed something; then he
      stooped and shouldered the heavy backlog and some smaller sticks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I &rsquo;ll give you-uns one more backlog to set by, anyhow,&rdquo; he said, huskily.
    </p>
    <p>
      She preceded him into the sitting-room and stood over him while he raked
      out the hot coals and deposited the log against the back part of the
      fireplace. Then she turned into the kitchen and approached her sister, who
      was frying meat in an iron pan on the coals.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marty,&rdquo; she said, unsteadily, &ldquo;ef you begin on Dick I &rsquo;ll go off fer
      good. I can&rsquo;t stand that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Wakeman folded her stern lips, as if to keep them under check, and
      shrugged her shoulders. That was all the response she made.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucinda turned back into the sitting-room, where the dining-table stood.
      To-night she put three plates on the white cloth; one of them had been
      Dick&rsquo;s for years. She put it at the end of the table where he had sat when
      he was the head of the house. As she did so she caught his shifting glance
      and smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to make you feel as ef nothin&rsquo; in the world had happened, Dick,&rdquo;
       she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been a-fixin&rsquo; you a bed in the company-room, but you jest
      must be sensible about that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Law! anything will suit me,&rdquo; he began. But the entrance of Marty
      interrupted his remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      She put the bread, the coffee, the meat, and the gravy on the table, and
      sat down in her place without a word. Lucinda glanced at Wakeman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come on, Dick,&rdquo; she called out. &ldquo;I &rsquo;ll bet yo&rsquo; &lsquo;re hungry as a bear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He drew out the chair that had been placed for him and sat down. Now an
      awkward situation presented itself. In the absence of a man Marty always
      asked the blessing. Lucinda wondered what would take place; one thing she
      knew well, and that was that Marty was too punctilious in religious
      matters to touch a bite of food before grace had been said by some one.
      But just then she noticed something about Wakeman that sent a little
      thrill of horror through her. Evidently his long life in prison had caused
      him to retrograde into utter forgetfulness of the existence of table
      etiquette, for he had drawn the great dish of fried meat toward him and
      was critically eying the various parts as he slowly turned it round.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a fool I am,&rdquo; he said, the delightful savor of the meat rendering
      him momentarily oblivious of his former wife&rsquo;s forbidding aspect. &ldquo;I laid
      aside the lights o&rsquo; that littlest shote an&rsquo; firmly intended to ax you to
      fry &rsquo;em fer me, but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lucinda&rsquo;s stare convinced him that something had gone wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marty&rsquo;s waitin&rsquo; fer somebody to ax the blessin&rsquo;,&rdquo; she explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blessin&rsquo;? Good gracious!&rdquo; he grunted, his effusiveness dried up. &ldquo;That
      went clean out &rsquo;n my mind. But a body that&rsquo;s tuk his meals on a tin plate
      in a row o&rsquo; fellers waitin&rsquo; fer the&rsquo;r turn four years hand-runnin&rsquo;, ain&rsquo;t
      expected to&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went no further, seeming to realize that the picture he was drawing was
      tending to widen the distance between him and the uncompromising figure
      opposite him. He folded his hands so that his arms formed a frame for his
      plate, and said in a mellow bass voice: &ldquo;Good Lord, make us duly thankful
      fer the bounteous repast that Thy angels has seed fit to spread before us
      to-night. Cause each of us to inculcate sech a frame of mind as will not
      let us harbor ill will ag&rsquo;in our neighbors, an&rsquo; finally, when this shadowy
      abode is dispersed by the light of Thy glory, receive us all into Thy
      grace. This we beg in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He ended in some confusion. A red spot hovered over each of his
      cheek-bones. &ldquo;I clean forgot that part about good crops an&rsquo; fair weather,&rdquo;
       he said to Lucinda. &ldquo;But you see it&rsquo;s been four yeer sence I said it over,
      an&rsquo; a man o&rsquo; my age oughtn&rsquo;t to be expected to know a thing like a younger
      person.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Help yorese&rsquo;f to the meat an&rsquo; pass the dish to Marty.&rdquo; replied Miss
      Dykes. &ldquo;Ef I was you, I&rsquo;d not be continually a-bringin&rsquo; up things about
      the last four yeer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He made a hurried but bounteous choice of the parts of meat on the dish,
      and then gave it over into the outstretched hands of Lucinda. Marty was
      pouring out the coffee. She passed the old-fashioned mustache-cup to her
      sister, and that lady transferred it to Wakeman. He sipped from it
      lingeringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My Lord!&rdquo; he cried, impulsively. &ldquo;I tell you the God&rsquo;s truth; sech good
      coffee as this hain&rsquo;t been in a mile o&rsquo; my lips sence I went&mdash;sence I
      was heer,&rdquo; he corrected, as Lucinda&rsquo;s warning stare bore down on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      After that the meal proceeded in silence. When he had finished, Dick went
      back to his chair in the chimney-corner near the battered woodbox. After
      putting away the dishes and removing the cloth from the table, Lucinda
      came and sat down near him. Mrs. Wake-man, casting occasional furtive
      glances toward the front door, appropriated her share of the general
      silence in a seat where the firelight faded. Richard wore an unsettled
      air, as if getting into old harness came as awkward as putting on the new
      had come when he married, years before. After a few minutes he became a
      little drowsy, and began to act naturally, as if by force of returning
      habit. He unlaced his shoes, took them off, rubbed the bottoms of his
      feet, thrust those members toward the fire, and worked his toes. He also
      took a chew of tobacco. Profound silence was in the room; the thoughts of
      three minds percolated through it. Marty picked up the <i>Christian
      Advocate</i> and pretended to read, but she dropped it in her lap and cast
      another look toward the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rustling of the paper attracted Richard&rsquo;s gaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is she expectin&rsquo;&mdash;is anybody a-comin&rsquo;?&rdquo; He directed the question to
      Lucinda.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t be much surprised,&rdquo; was the answer. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Jeff Goardley&rsquo;s
      night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t say!&rdquo; Each of the words had a separate little jerk, and the
      questioning stare of the convict&rsquo;s eyes pierced the space intervening
      between him and his divorced wife. He spat into the fire, wiped his mouth
      with an unsteady hand, and caught his breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      Silence again. Lucinda broke it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You hain&rsquo;t never told us how you happened to git yore pardon,&rdquo; she
      ventured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By a streak o&rsquo; luck,&rdquo; Wakeman said, the languid largeness of his eyes
      showing that he was still struggling against the inclination to sleep.
      &ldquo;T&rsquo;other day the governor sent word to our superintendent that he was
      comin&rsquo; to see fer hisse&rsquo;f how we wus treated. The minute I heerd it, I
      said to myself, I did, &lsquo;Wakeman, you must have a talk with that man.&rsquo; So
      the mornin&rsquo; he got thar we wus all give a sort of vacation an&rsquo; stood up in
      rowslike fer inspection. When I seed &rsquo;im a-comin&rsquo; towards me I jest gazed
      at &rsquo;im with all my might an&rsquo; he got to lookin&rsquo; at me. When he got nigh me
      he stopped short an&rsquo; said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Looky&rsquo; heer, my man,&rsquo; said he; &lsquo;yore face seems mighty familiar to me.
      Have I ever seed you before?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Not unless you remember me a-throwin&rsquo; up my hat in front o&rsquo; the stan&rsquo;
      an&rsquo; yellin&rsquo; when you wus stump-speakin&rsquo; in Murray jest &lsquo;fore yore
      &lsquo;lection,&rsquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then he laughed kinder good-natured like, an&rsquo; said: &lsquo;I&rsquo;m sorry to see a
      voter o&rsquo; mine in a fix like yo&rsquo;r &lsquo;n. What can I do fer you?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I want to have a talk with you, yore Honor, an&rsquo; that bad,&rsquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I am at yore disposal,&rsquo; said he. &lsquo;That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m heer fer. I &rsquo;ll ax the
      superintendent to call you in a moment. What is yore name?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Richard Wakeman, yore Honor,&rsquo; said I. &ldquo;&lsquo;An&rsquo; one o&rsquo; the best men we ever
      had,&rsquo; said the superintendent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, they passed on, an&rsquo; in a few minutes I was ordered to come to the
      superintendent&rsquo;s office, an&rsquo; thar I found the governor tilted back smokin&rsquo;
      a fine cigar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;You wanted to have some &lsquo;n&rsquo; to say to me, Wakeman?&rsquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I eased my ball an&rsquo; chain down on the skin of a big-eyed varmint o&rsquo; some
      sort, an&rsquo; stood up straight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I did, yore Honor, an&rsquo; that bad,&rsquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;What is it?&rsquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I want to put my case before you, yore Honor,&rsquo; said I. &lsquo;An&rsquo; I&rsquo;m not
      a-goin&rsquo; to begin, as every convict does, by sayin&rsquo; he ain&rsquo;t guilty, fer I
      know you&rsquo;ve heerd that tale tell yo&rsquo; &lsquo;re heartily sick of it.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;But are you guilty?&rsquo; said the governor. &lsquo;I <i>have</i> seed men sent up
      fer crimes they never committed.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Yore Honor,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t no more intend to steal that hoss o&rsquo; Pike
      Williams&rsquo;s than you did&mdash;not a bit. Gittin&rsquo; on a spree about once a
      year is my main fault, an&rsquo; it was Christmas, an&rsquo; all of us was full o&rsquo;
      devilment. It was at the Springplace bar, an&rsquo; Alf Moreland struck me a
      whack across the face with his whip, an&rsquo; bein&rsquo; astraddle of a fine nag he
      made off. Pike&rsquo;s nag was hitched at the rack nigh me, an&rsquo;, without hardly
      knowin&rsquo; what I was doin&rsquo;, I jumped on it an&rsquo; spurred off after Alf. I run
      &rsquo;im nip an&rsquo; tuck fer about seven mile, an&rsquo; then me an&rsquo; him rid on fer more
      whisky down the valley. The next day I was arrested, so drunk they had to
      haul me to jail in a wagon. They tried me before a jury o&rsquo; men that never
      did like me, an&rsquo; I got five yeer.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I stopped thar to draw a fresh breath the governor axed, &lsquo;Is that
      what you wanted to say, Wakeman?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Not a word of it, yore Honor,&rsquo; said I. &lsquo;I jest wanted to put a straight
      question to you about the law. Ef you knowed that a man was a-sufferin&rsquo; a
      sight more on account of imprisonment than his sentence called fer, would
      that be right?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The governor studied a minute, then he kinder smiled at the
      superintendent, an&rsquo; said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;That&rsquo;s a question fer the conscience. Ef a man is imprisoned fer a crime,
      an&rsquo; jail life breaks his health down, an&rsquo; is killin&rsquo; &lsquo;im, then he ort to
      be pardoned out.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I had &rsquo;im right whar I wanted &lsquo;im, an&rsquo; I up an&rsquo; told &rsquo;im that I had
      a wife that was all the world to me, an&rsquo; that durin&rsquo; my term mischievous
      folks had lied ag&rsquo;in me an&rsquo; persuaded &rsquo;er to git a divorce, an&rsquo; that a
      oily-tongued scamp was a-tryin&rsquo; to marry &rsquo;er fer what little land she had.
      I reminded &rsquo;im that I was put in fer stealin&rsquo;, an that I had worked four
      yeer o&rsquo; my sentence, an&rsquo; that it looked like a good deal o&rsquo; punishment fer
      jest one spree, but that I wouldn&rsquo;t complain, bein&rsquo; as I was cured of the
      liquor habit an&rsquo; never intended to put the neck of a bottle to my mouth
      ag&rsquo;in, but that I did kinder want to hurry back home &lsquo;fore too much damage
      was done.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m not lyin&rsquo; when I say the governor&rsquo;s eyes was wet. All of a
      sudden he helt out his han&rsquo; to me an&rsquo; said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I feel shore you never intended to steal that hoss, Wakeman.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;My wife never has believed it fer one instant,&rsquo; said the superintendent.
      &lsquo;An&rsquo; it takes a woman to ferret out guilt.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The governor tuk a sheet o&rsquo; paper an&rsquo; a pen an&rsquo; said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Wakeman, I&rsquo;m a-goin&rsquo; to pardon you, an&rsquo; what&rsquo;s more, I inten&rsquo; to send a
      statement to all the newspapers that I&rsquo;m convinced you are a wronged man.
      I&rsquo;ve done wuss than you was accused of in my young days, an&rsquo; had the cheek
      to run fer the office of governor.&rsquo;&rdquo; Then the superintendent&rsquo;s wife come
      in an&rsquo; stood up thar an&rsquo; cried, an&rsquo; axed to be allowed to unlock my
      manacles. She got out my old suit&mdash;this un heer&mdash;an&rsquo; breshed it
      &lsquo;erself, an&rsquo; kept on a-cryin&rsquo; an&rsquo; a-laughin&rsquo; at the same time The last
      words that she said to me was:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Wakeman, go home an&rsquo; make up with yore wife; she won&rsquo;t turn ag&rsquo;in you
      when you git back to the old place whar you an&rsquo; her has lived together so
      long, an&rsquo; whar yore child&rsquo;s grave is.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The speaker paused. For a man so coarse in appearance, his tone had grown
      remarkably tender. Lucinda was staring wide-eyed, with a fixed aspect of
      features, as if she were half frightened at the unwonted commotion within
      herself and the danger of its appearing on the surface. Finally she took
      refuge in the act of raising her apron to her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Wakeman had excellent command over herself, drawing upon a vast fund
      of offended pride, the interest of which had compounded within the last
      four years. Just at this crisis the steady beat of a horse&rsquo;s hoofs broke
      into the hushed stillness of the room. Lucinda lowered her apron with
      wrists that seemed jointless bone, and stared at her sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you a-goin&rsquo; to let that feller stick his head inside that door
      to-night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The question was ill-timed, for it produced only a haughty, contemptuous
      shrug in the woman from whom it rebounded. Wakeman did not take his eyes
      from the fire. They heard the gate-latch click, and then a heavy-booted
      and spurred foot fell on the entry step. The next instant the door was
      unceremoniously opened and a tall, lank mountaineer entered. He was at the
      fag-end of bachelorhood, had sharp, thin features, a small mustache dyed
      black, and reddish locks which were long and curling. He wore a heavy gray
      shawl over his shoulders. At first he did not see Wakeman, for his eyes
      had found employment in trying to discover why Marty had not risen as he
      came in. He glanced inquiringly at Lucinda, and then he recognized
      Richard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My Lord!&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;I had no idee you&mdash;I &lsquo;lowed you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t nuther,&rdquo; Richard sneered, the red firelight revealing strange
      flashes in his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      For some instants the visitor stood on the hearth awkwardly disrobing his
      sinewy hands. Finally, unheeding Lucinda&rsquo;s admonitory glances toward the
      door, and the prayerful current from her eyes to his, he sat down near
      Marty. Ten minutes by the clock on the mantelpiece passed, in which time
      nothing was heard except the lowing of the cattle in the cow-lot and the
      sizzling of the coals when Richard spat. At last a portion of Wakeman&rsquo;s
      wandering self-confidence resettled upon him, and it became him well. He
      crossed his legs easily, dropped his quid of tobacco into the fire, and
      with a determined gaze began to prod his squirming rival.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lookye heer,&rdquo; he said, suddenly. &ldquo;What did you come heer fur, anyhow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Goardley leaned forward and spat between his linked hands. He accomplished
      it with no slight effort, for the inactivity of his mouth, which was not
      chewing anything, had produced a hot dryness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he managed to say. &ldquo;I jest thought I&rsquo;d come around.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ride?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, hoss-back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know whar you hitched?&rdquo; Goardley hesitated and glanced helplessly
      at Marty, who, stern-faced, inflexible, was looking at the paper in her
      lap.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hitched under the cherry-tree out thar,&rdquo; he answered, with scarcely a
      touch of self-confidence in his tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, go unhitch an&rsquo; git astraddle of yore animal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Goardley blinked, but did not rise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t have the least idee you had got free, Dick, an&rsquo;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you know it now, so git out to that hoss, ur by all that&rsquo;s holy&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Wakeman drew herself erect and crumpled the paper in her bony hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is my house,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;an&rsquo; I ain&rsquo;t no married woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The white fixity of Goardley&rsquo;s countenance relaxed in a slow grin. An
      automatic affair it was, but as he took in the situation it was a
      recognition of the aid which had arrived at the last minute.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wakeman stood up in his stockinged feet. He was still unruffled. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a
      fact; the place is her &lsquo;n,&rdquo; he admitted. &ldquo;But I &rsquo;ll tell you one article
      that ain&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s that thar shootin&rsquo;-iron on them deer-horns up thar, an&rsquo;
      ef you don&rsquo;t git out &rsquo;n heer forthwith it &rsquo;ll make the fust hole in meat
      that it&rsquo;s made in four yeer. Maybe me &rsquo;n Marty <i>ain&rsquo;t</i> man an&rsquo; wife,
      but when we wuz married the preacher said, &lsquo;What the Lord has j&rsquo;ined
      together let no man put asunder,&rsquo; an&rsquo; I ain&rsquo;t a-goin&rsquo; to set still an&rsquo; see
      a dirty, oily-tongued scamp like you try to undo the Lord&rsquo;s work. You know
      the way out, an&rsquo; I was too late fer hog-killin&rsquo;. I went into the
      penitentiary fer jest one spree, but I &rsquo;ll go in fer manslaughter next
      time an&rsquo; serve my term more cheerful&mdash;I mought say with Christian
      fortitude.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cowardice produced the dominant expression in Goardley&rsquo;s face. He rose and
      backed from the room. The convict thumped across the resounding floor to
      the door and looked out after the departing man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Run like a skeered dog,&rdquo; he laughed, impulsively, as he turned back into
      the room. And then he waxed serious as he entered the atmosphere circling
      about Marty, who, with a stormy brow, sat immovable, her eyes downcast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t help it, to save me,&rdquo; he began, apologetically, to her
      profile. &ldquo;But I reckon you an&rsquo; me can manage to git along like we used to,
      an&rsquo; I never would &lsquo;a&rsquo; had any respect fer myself ef I had a-let that scamp
      set heer an&rsquo; think he was a-courtin&rsquo; of you right before my eyes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marty made no reply. A flush of suppressed emotion had risen in her cheeks
      and was taking on a deeper tinge. Richard grunted, stepped half-way back
      to his chimney-corner, and looked at her again. Seeing her eyes still
      averted, he grunted aloud, and went to his chair and sat down. Several
      minutes passed. Then Lucinda&rsquo;s prayerful eyes saw his hand, now quivering,
      reach behind him and draw his shoes in front of him. He put them on, but
      did not tie the strings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Somehow,&rdquo; he said, rising, &ldquo;somehow, now that I come to think of it, I
      don&rsquo;t feel exactly right&mdash;exactly as I used to&mdash;an&rsquo; I reckon,
      maybe, I ort to go some&rsquo;rs else. I reckon, as you said jest now, that in
      the eyes o&rsquo; some folks you ain&rsquo;t no married woman, an&rsquo; I have been makin&rsquo;
      purty free fer a jail-bird. Old Uncle Billy Hodkins won&rsquo;t set his dogs on
      me, an&rsquo; I &rsquo;ll go over thar tonight. After that the Lord only knows whar I
      will head fer. Uncle Billy never did believe I was guilty; he&rsquo;s writ me
      that a dozen times.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he moved toward the door, in a clattering, slipshod fashion, Lucinda
      fixed Marty with a fierce stare.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you a-goin&rsquo; to set thar an&rsquo; let Dick leave us fer good?&rdquo; she hurled
      at her fiercely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marty made no reply save that which was embodied in a would-be defiant
      shrug, but the flow of blood had receded from her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ef you do, you ain&rsquo;t no Christian woman, that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; was Lucinda&rsquo;s
      half-sobbing, half-shrieked accusation. &ldquo;Yo&rsquo; &lsquo;re a purty thing to set up
      an&rsquo; drink the sacrament with a heart in you that the Old Nick&rsquo;s fire
      couldn&rsquo;t melt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The convict smiled back at his defender from the threshold; then they
      heard him cross the entry and step down on the gravel walk. He had passed
      the bars and was turning up the side of a little hill, on the brow of
      which a few gravestones shimmered in the moonlight, when he heard his name
      called from the entry. It was Lucinda&rsquo;s voice; she came to him, her hair
      flying in the wind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I &lsquo;lowed,&rdquo; he said, sheepishly, as she paused to catch her breath, &ldquo;I
      jest &lsquo;lowed I&rsquo;d go up thar an&rsquo; see ef the water had been washin&rsquo; out round
      Annie&rsquo;s grave. The last time I looked at it the foot-rock was a little
      sagged to one side.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come back in the house, Dick,&rdquo; cried the old maid. &ldquo;Marty has completely
      broke down. She&rsquo;s cryin&rsquo; like a baby. She has been actin&rsquo; stubborn beca&rsquo;se
      she was proud an&rsquo; afeerd folks would think she was a fool about you. As
      soon as I told &rsquo;er you didn&rsquo;t say that about bein&rsquo; willin&rsquo; to go to jail
      to git out &rsquo;n reach o&rsquo; &rsquo;er tongue, she axed me to run after you. She&rsquo;s
      consented to make it up ef we will send over fer the justice an&rsquo; have the
      marryin&rsquo; done to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you a-tellin&rsquo; me the truth, Lucinda?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As the Lord is my witness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stared at the farmhouse a moment; then he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you an&rsquo; her git everything ready, an&rsquo; I &rsquo;ll git Squire Dow an&rsquo; the
      license. I &rsquo;ll be back as soon as I kin.&rdquo;

      A RURAL VISITOR
    </h2>

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">L</span>ucinda Gibbs stood
      in the corner of the rail fence behind her cottage. Her face was damp with
      perspiration, and her heavy iron-gray hair had become disarranged and hung
      down her back below the skirt of her gingham sun-bonnet. She was raking
      the decayed leaves and dead weeds from her tender strawberry sprouts and
      mentally calculating on an abundant crop of the luscious fruit later in
      the spring.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The trouble is I won&rsquo;t git to eat none of &lsquo;em,&rdquo; she sighed, as she looked
      up and addressed the woman on the other side of the fence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean that you are actually a-goin&rsquo; shore &lsquo;nough, Mis&rsquo; Gibbs?&rdquo;
       exclaimed Betsey Lowry, as she leaned heavily on the top rail.
    </p>
    <p>
      The widow reversed her rake and began to pull out the leaves which were
      packed between the metal teeth, her face reddening gradually, as if she
      were slightly irritated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to know ef thar&rsquo;s anything strange about my goin&rsquo;,&rdquo; she said,
      coldly. &ldquo;You said you&rsquo;d feed my cat an&rsquo; chickens an&rsquo; attend to the cow fer
      what she&rsquo;d give.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it ain&rsquo;t because I have the least objection to keepin&rsquo; my word about
      them things,&rdquo; said the old maid, quickly. &ldquo;Goodness knows, me an&rsquo; Joel
      needs the milk an&rsquo; butter bad enough, an&rsquo; it ain&rsquo;t one speck o&rsquo; trouble
      jest to throw scraps to the cat, an&rsquo; meal-dough to the chickens, but
      somehow it skeers me to think of a lone woman like you a-goin&rsquo; all the way
      to New York by yorese&rsquo;f.&rdquo; Mrs. Gibbs leaned the rake against the fence.
      The flush died out of her face, giving place to a sweet, wistful
      expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Betsey,&rdquo; she said, tremulously, &ldquo;tell me the truth. Do you think I ought
      to stay at home?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old maid turned to look through the orchard of leafless trees to her
      own house not far away. She had reddened slightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ef you push me fer a answer, Mis&rsquo; Gibbs, I &rsquo;ll have to tell you I don&rsquo;t
      think you ought to go away up thar all alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You feel that-a-way, Betsey, because you hain&rsquo;t never had no child an&rsquo;
      been separated from it like I have. When Amos married up thar an&rsquo; went to
      housekeepin&rsquo; it mighty nigh killed me. An&rsquo; then I begun to live on the
      bare hope that he&rsquo;d come South on a visit, but he hain&rsquo;t done it, an&rsquo; thar
      ain&rsquo;t no prospect of the like. He says he cayn&rsquo;t git away frum his
      business without dead loss, an&rsquo; they want me to come. I&rsquo;ve said many a
      time that I&rsquo;d never leave my home, but, Betsey, it seems to me that I
      cayn&rsquo;t live another week without seein&rsquo; how Amos looks. The Lord only
      knows how lonely I am mighty nigh all the time. Ef Susie had lived, she&rsquo;d
      never &lsquo;a&rsquo; left me, married or not, but it&rsquo;s different with a man.
      Sometimes I wonder why the Lord tuk &rsquo;em both frum me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Betsey&rsquo;s kindly face softened. The intervening fence kept her from putting
      a consoling arm around her neighbor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hain&rsquo;t been blind&mdash;nur Brother Joel hain&rsquo;t nuther&mdash;to yore
      lonely way o&rsquo; livin&rsquo;,&rdquo; she said, sympathetically. &ldquo;Thar&rsquo;s hardly a night
      that me an&rsquo; him don&rsquo;t look out &lsquo;fore we go to bed to see ef you are still
      a-sittin&rsquo; up readin&rsquo; by yore lamp. I kin always tell when you are
      a-thinkin&rsquo; about Susie more &rsquo;n common; it&rsquo;s always when you git back frum
      &rsquo;er grave that you set up latest. I believe in layin&rsquo; on o&rsquo; flowers an&rsquo;
      plantin&rsquo; shrubs that &rsquo;ll keep sech a precious spot green, but when it
      seems to make a body brood-like, then I think it ought not to be indulged
      in to any great extent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s raily a sort of comfort to go to the graveyard,&rdquo; faltered Mrs.
      Gibbs; and she raised her apron to her mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long do you intend to stay with Amos an&rsquo; his wife?&rdquo; asked Betsey, to
      divert the widow&rsquo;s thoughts. She looked over her shoulder, and saw her
      brother Joel, a tall, strong-looking man about fifty-five years of age,
      approaching from the direction of his store, down at the cross-roads.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three months, I reckon,&rdquo; replied the widow. &ldquo;I know in reason that I
      won&rsquo;t want to leave Amos a bit sooner. You see, it may be a long time
      before I lay eyes on &rsquo;im again. They say the baby is doin&rsquo; fine, an&rsquo; I
      want to see it an&rsquo; nuss it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you are raily goin&rsquo;?&rdquo; cried Joel Lowry, as he leaned on the fence
      beside his sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m a-goin&rsquo; to make the trip, Joel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a long ways,&rdquo; returned the storekeeper, &ldquo;an&rsquo; I don&rsquo;t see how you are
      a-goin&rsquo; by yorese&rsquo;f. Ef it was jest a few weeks later, now, I might pull
      up an&rsquo; go along. I&rsquo;ve always believed ef I went to New York to lay in
      stock that I could save enough on my goods to defray my expenses thar an&rsquo;
      back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The eyes of the widow flashed eagerly. She took a long, trembling breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wisht to goodness you would,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know one thing about
      trains, an&rsquo; I am powerful afraid I &rsquo;ll make a bobble of the whole thing
      from start to finish. Ef I was to git on the wrong car&mdash;but what is
      the use to cross a bridge &lsquo;fore you git to it? Mebby I &rsquo;ll git thar all
      right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hate mightily to have you try it,&rdquo; replied Joel, reflectively, as he
      stroked his short gray beard. &ldquo;I jest wish you would think better of it.
      I&rsquo;m a leetle grain older &rsquo;n you, Mis&rsquo; Gibbs, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ve been about some.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gibbs drew her rake after her as she turned toward her cottage. &ldquo;I
      don&rsquo;t want to change my mind,&rdquo; she said, emphatically. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m bent on seein&rsquo;
      Amos, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;m a-goin&rsquo; to do it. I&rsquo;d better go in now. I&rsquo;ve got a lot o&rsquo;
      packin&rsquo; to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Joel went back toward his store across a field of decaying corn-stubble
      without looking round, and Betsey climbed over the fence and went into the
      cottage with her neighbor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never hated to see a body go so in all my born days,&rdquo; she sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gibbs opened the front door and preceded Betsey into the room on the
      right of the little hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t mind how things looks in heer,&rdquo; she apologized. &ldquo;I left my
      trunk open right spank in the middle of the room, so whenever I see a
      thing that ought to go in I kin jest fling it at the trunk an&rsquo; put it away
      when I have time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Betsey stood over the little hair trunk and looked down dolefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What on earth is that I smell?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Sassafras, as I&rsquo;m alive!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I dug it yesterday. Amos likes sassafras-root tea; he used to drink
      a power of it to thin his blood in the spring; he writ that he hain&rsquo;t had
      a taste of it sence he left heer. Shorely, it&rsquo;s come to a purty pass if a
      body cayn&rsquo;t get sech as that in a big city like New York.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seems to me,&rdquo; remarked the old maid, &ldquo;that you&rsquo;ve got a sight more truck
      here than you &rsquo;ll have any need fer. What&rsquo;s this greasy mess wrapped up?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s mutton suet,&rdquo; was the enthusiastic reply. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the whitest cake I
      ever laid eyes on. They &rsquo;ll need it fer chapped hands an&rsquo; lips. Amos says
      it&rsquo;s a sight colder up thar. That&rsquo;s ginger-cake in that paper box, an&rsquo;
      I&rsquo;ve made him an&rsquo; Sally some wool socks an&rsquo; stockin&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you shore you are a-goin&rsquo; to be away three months?&rdquo; asked Betsey,
      with a sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mebby longer than that,&rdquo; answered the old woman. &ldquo;I feel like I never
      will want to leave Amos again, but I couldn&rsquo;t be away from my home always,
      you know. La, it &rsquo;ll seem powerful strange to wake up an&rsquo; not look out o&rsquo;
      that thar window towards the mountain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An&rsquo; not to heer the hens a-cacklin&rsquo;, an&rsquo; the cow an&rsquo; calf a-bellowin&rsquo;,&rdquo;
       added Betsey. Then she put her handkerchief to her eyes and plunged
      hastily from the room. Mrs. Gibbs moved quickly to the window and looked
      out. She saw Betsey climb over the fence and go on through the orchard,
      her head hanging down.
    </p>

    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he evening before
      the day appointed for Mrs. Gibbs&rsquo;s departure, Betsey came in out of
      breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you reckon?&rdquo; she asked, as she stood over the hair trunk, which,
      roped and labeled, stood on end near the widow&rsquo;s bed. &ldquo;What you reckon?
      Joel has made up his mind to go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The widow was putting a brightly polished tin coffee-pot into an
      old-fashioned carpetbag which stood on the white counterpane of her bed.
      She stood erect, her hands on her hips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Looky&rsquo; heer, Betsey,&rdquo; she exclaimed, excitedly, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you joke with me!
      I&rsquo;ve jest worried over this undertakin&rsquo; till I&rsquo;ve lost every speck of
      appetite fer my victuals. I tell you I ain&rsquo;t in no frame o&rsquo; mind fer any
      light talk on the subject.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a-goin&rsquo;, I tell you!&rdquo; declared the old maid. &ldquo;I never dreamt he was
      in earnest the other day when he fust mentioned it, but all last night he
      liter&rsquo;ly rolled an&rsquo; tumbled an&rsquo; couldn&rsquo;t git a wink o&rsquo; sleep fer worrryin&rsquo;
      over you an&rsquo; yore wild-cat project. This mornin&rsquo; the fust thing he said
      was that he&rsquo;d made up his mind to go ef he could git a round-trip ticket
      thar an&rsquo; back. He told me not to say anything to you tell he had sent to
      town. Jest a minute ago Jeff Woods got back with the ticket. Joel seems
      mightily tickled over goin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gibbs sat down. A serious expression had come over her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ef I&rsquo;d &lsquo;a&rsquo; knowed he raily meant to go I&rsquo;d &lsquo;a&rsquo; stopped &lsquo;im,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I
      don&rsquo;t want to be a bother an&rsquo; a burden to my neighbors. Betsey, I&rsquo;m
      a-gittin&rsquo; to be a lots o&rsquo; trouble to other folks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pshaw!&rdquo; cried Betsey. &ldquo;Ef Joel hadn&rsquo;t &lsquo;a&rsquo; wanted to go he&rsquo;d not &lsquo;a&rsquo;
      bought the ticket. La me, now I &rsquo;ll have to go git <i>him</i> ready.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The next morning, arrayed in his best suit of clothes, new high top-boots,
      and a venerable silk hat, Joel drove to the widow&rsquo;s cottage in his spring
      wagon. While she was locking up the doors he and a negro farmhand placed
      the widow&rsquo;s trunk into the back part of the wagon. The neighbors from the
      farmhouses down the red clay road and across the gray fields and meadows
      gathered at the gate. When Mrs. Gibbs emerged, their mental comment was
      that she looked ten years younger than before deciding on the journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All that flushed face an&rsquo; shiny eyes is &lsquo;ca&rsquo;se she&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to Amos,&rdquo;
       remarked a woman who held a little bare-footed boy by the hand. The woman
      addressed was an unmarried woman old enough to be a grandmother. She
      looked at the widow&rsquo;s beaming visage, gave her head a significant toss,
      and said, contemptuously: &ldquo;I say! That woman ain&rsquo;t a-thinkin&rsquo; no more
      &rsquo;bout Amos &lsquo;an I am at this minute. It looks to me like some people can&rsquo;t
      see a inch before their faces. My Lor&rsquo;, you make me laugh, Mis&rsquo; Ruggles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Arriving at the station, Joel turned the widow&rsquo;s trunk over to the
      baggage-master, and with her carpet-bag and his own clutched in one hand,
      he stood on the platform pulling his beard nervously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We &rsquo;ll have to spend one night on the train,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I never thought
      to mention it, but they tell me that a body kin, by payin&rsquo; a fraction
      more, git a place to lie down and stretch out, an&rsquo; snooze a bit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The widow seemed to have made up her mind that she would not show crude
      astonishment at anything new to her experience, but her curiosity finally
      caused her to admit that she had never heard of such an arrangement. So,
      to the best of his ability, the storekeeper entered into a description of
      a sleeping-car, lowering the carpet-bags to the platform, and making signs
      and drawing imaginary lines with his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Men an&rsquo; women in the same car with jest curtains stretched betwixt?&rdquo; she
      cried. &ldquo;No, thank you! I won&rsquo;t make a fool o&rsquo; myse&rsquo;f if other women does.
      I kin set up fer one night easy enough, I reckon. I&rsquo;ve done the like many
      a time with the sick an&rsquo; the dead without feeling the wuss fer it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hardly &lsquo;lowed it would suit,&rdquo; stammered Joel, &ldquo;but I thought thar would
      be no harm in givin&rsquo; you yore choice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not the least in the world, Joel;&rdquo; and then she paled, caught her breath,
      and grabbed her carpet-bag, for the people on the platform were hurrying
      about; the train was coming.
    </p>
    <h3>
      III
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>n the train they
      found a seat together, and when the locomotive shrieked and they dashed
      off through deep cuts and over high trestles, Mrs. Gibbs was unable to
      control her excitement. He saw that she was holding tightly to the arm of
      the seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have never been on sech a fast one before,&rdquo; she said, tremulously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She don&rsquo;t whiz nigh like some I&rsquo;ve rid on out West,&rdquo; replied Joel, with
      an air of conscious importance, even guardianship.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few minutes later she grew calmer. Happening to catch her eye, he saw
      that her mind was far away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was jest a-thinkin&rsquo; how awful it is to be leavin&rsquo; Susie&rsquo;s grave so fur
      behind,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to Amos, but my other child is back thar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was thinkin&rsquo; about Rachel&rsquo;s grave jest a minute ago,&rdquo; he returned. &ldquo;You
      called &rsquo;er to my mind jest now. Somehow you have the same sort of a look
      about the eyes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shucks! that ain&rsquo;t so, I know!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s true as I live!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, she was a good woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The best I ever run across, an&rsquo; knowed rail well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sun, seen first on one side of the car and then on the other, went
      down. The train porter laid a plank across the ends of the seats and
      climbed up on it and lighted the lamps overhead. This made the space
      outside look like a black curtain softly flapping against the car. The
      widow opened her carpet-bag and took out something wrapped in a napkin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Betsey said you loved fried chicken an&rsquo; biscuits,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s my favorite dish,&rdquo; he replied, stiltedly, readily cloaking himself
      in his best table manners.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m dyin&rsquo; fer a cup o&rsquo; coffee,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;This dry food will clog in my
      throat without some &lsquo;n&rsquo; to wash it down. I put in a package o&rsquo; ground
      coffee an&rsquo; my littlest coffee-pot, thinkin&rsquo; thar might be some way to boil
      water, but I don&rsquo;t see no chance. You say we don&rsquo;t stop long enough to git
      supper?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what the conductor said.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But at the next station, where they stopped for only a minute, he took the
      coffee-pot and hurried out. The train started on, and she was greatly
      alarmed, thinking that he was left, but he had entered the rear door and
      now approached with the coffee-pot steaming at the spout.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, ef you&rsquo;ve jest got a cup about you we &rsquo;ll be all hunkydory,&rdquo; he
      laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her face lighted up with combined pleasure and relief. &ldquo;Well, I certainly
      &lsquo;lowed you was left back thar,&rdquo; she laughed. &ldquo;An&rsquo; how on earth did you git
      the coffee?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They sell it by the quart on the platform,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;I drapped onto
      that trick once when I was on my way to Californy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She got out a tin cup and filled it with the coffee. &ldquo;I never was so
      downright grateful fer a thing in my life,&rdquo; she remarked. &ldquo;Now, help
      yorese&rsquo;f, an&rsquo; I &rsquo;ll sip some along with my chicken an&rsquo; bread.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t tech it tell you&rsquo;ve had all you feel like takin&rsquo;,&rdquo; said he,
      gallantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The coffee and the lunch seemed to stimulate them both, for they sat and
      chatted and laughed together till past eleven o&rsquo;clock. Then he noticed
      that she was growing sleepy, so he took the vacant seat behind her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It &rsquo;ll give you more room,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      By and by he saw her head fall forward. She was asleep. He rolled up his
      overcoat in the shape of a pillow and placed it on the end of the seat,
      and touching her gently, he told her to lie down and rest her head on the
      coat. She obeyed, with a drowsy smile of gratitude. He watched her all
      through the night. She slept soundly, like a tired child.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never seed a body look so much like Rachel in all my life,&rdquo; he said
      several times to himself. &ldquo;Pore woman! I&rsquo;m that glad I come with &lsquo;er!
      She&rsquo;s had &rsquo;er grief, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ve had mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The stopping of the train a little after the break of day roused her. She
      sat up and rubbed her eyes. He did not wait to speak to her, but taking
      the coffee-pot, he ran out at the door behind her, so that her first
      glimpse of him was when he appeared before her with more hot coffee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must take a cup to start you out fer the day,&rdquo; he smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do beat the world, Joel!&rdquo; she laughed. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t &lsquo;a&rsquo; done without
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She made room for him beside her, and they ate breakfast together. The
      rest of the journey they sat watching the changing landscape, remarking
      upon the different methods of tilling the soil, and talking of home and
      their neighbors.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s strange how people can live as nigh to one another as me an&rsquo; you
      have an&rsquo; not git better acquainted,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I declare, you ain&rsquo;t a bit
      like I thought you was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never railly knowed you, nuther, Joel,&rdquo; she laughed. &ldquo;You was always
      sech a busy, say-nothin&rsquo; sort of a man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An&rsquo; right now you are off to stay a long time, and I &rsquo;ll have to go back
      to the backwoods. I wonder ef&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went no farther, and she did not help him out. She had suddenly grown
      reticent, and seemed occupied with the landscape, which was rushing
      southward like a swollen stream of level farming lands, in which floated
      houses, fences, twisting trees, and waltzing men and horses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon you &rsquo;ll stay up thar all the spring an&rsquo; summer,&rdquo; he said at
      last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t like to leave Amos right away,&rdquo; she made answer. &ldquo;You see, I
      hain&rsquo;t seed the boy fer a long time, an&rsquo; I hain&rsquo;t thought o&rsquo; nothin&rsquo; but
      him fer many a day.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>hey arrived in New
      York at six o&rsquo;clock that evening. Amos met them at the train. They hardly
      recognized him in his silk hat, long overcoat, stylish necktie, and kid
      gloves. Joel did not approve of what he considered a rather dudish dress,
      but he overlooked that when he saw how happy the young man was at the
      sight of his mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I could invite you to my house, Mr. Lowry,&rdquo; said Amos, cordially,
      &ldquo;but the truth is, we have only a small flat, and there is hardly room for
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, never mind me,&rdquo; said Joel. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a-goin&rsquo; to a tavern nigh whar I do my
      tradin&rsquo;. I &rsquo;ll tell you good day now, but I &rsquo;ll run in an&rsquo; see ef Mis&rsquo;
      Gibbs has any word to send back when I start home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did not see her again for a week. He had concluded his purchases, and
      was ready to return South, when he decided to look her up. Finding her was
      more difficult than he had imagined. After several hours&rsquo; search on the
      east side of the city, she being on the west, he finally reached the big
      building which contained Amos&rsquo;s flat. Here he became involved in another
      mystery, for he found the front door, a glistening plate-glass affair,
      firmly locked, and no bell in sight. He stood in the tiled vestibule for
      several minutes deliberating on what was best to do. Fortunately, he saw a
      policeman passing, and hailed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a friend a-livin&rsquo; somewhar in this shebang,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but you
      may hang me ef I know how to git at &lsquo;im.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is his name on one of the letter-boxes?&rdquo; asked the policeman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What letter-boxes?&rdquo; questioned Joel. &ldquo;I hain&rsquo;t seed no names.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With an amused aspect of countenance the policeman mounted the steps and
      went into the vestibule. Here he opened some wooden doors in the wall,
      disclosing to view a long row of letter-boxes with the cards of their
      owners beneath them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s your friend?&rdquo; he asked, kindly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Amos Gibbs. I&rsquo;ve knowed &rsquo;im ever sence he was a little&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There,&rdquo; interrupted the policeman. &ldquo;I pushed the button. That rang a bell
      inside, and they will open the door by electricity if anybody is at home.
      When you hear the latch clicking, push the door open and go in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He disappeared down the street, and then Joel was roused from apathetic
      helplessness by a rapid clicking in the lock. He opened the door and went
      in. It was fortunate that Amos lived on the first floor, or even then Joel
      would not have known how to proceed farther. As it was, another door at
      the end of the heavily carpeted hall opened and a servant girl in white
      cap and apron put out her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, in answer to his inquiry. Mrs. Gibbs was at home, He
      followed her into a little parlor facing the street, with a single window.
      It was furnished more neatly than any room Joel had ever been in. The
      polished hardwood floor was covered with rugs of various kinds and sizes,
      and the room contained a bookcase, an upright piano, pictures, and pieces
      of bric-a-brac such as the store-keeper had never seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gibbs entered from the dining-room in the rear. Her hair was done up
      in a new style, which made her head appear larger than usual, and she wore
      a shining black silk gown that added height, dignity, and youth to her
      general aspect. She gave him her hand, and her whole attire rustled as she
      sat down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you got heer at last,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I &lsquo;lowed you never would come.
      I&rsquo;ve been lookin&rsquo; fer you every day. I hain&rsquo;t hardly done anything else
      sence I got heer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Joel stared, flushed, and tensely folded his hands anew. It seemed to him
      that he would not have suffered such a dire lack of words if she had not
      been looking so fine. It was as if his stalwart masculinity were a glaring
      misfit among the dainty gewgaws about him. He was mortally afraid the
      slender gilded chair he was sitting on would break under his two hundred
      weight. He had never imagined that dress could make such a change in the
      appearance of any one. The only features about her which seemed natural
      were her voice and a triangular bit of her wrinkled face which showed
      through her low-parted hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I come as soon as I got through,&rdquo; he heard himself say; and then he
      cleared his throat from a great depth as an apology for the frailty of his
      tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I kin see you think I&rsquo;m a sight to behold,&rdquo; she laughed, merrily. &ldquo;Sally
      fixed me up this-a-way: She fluted my hair with a hot curlin&rsquo; fork, an&rsquo;
      combed it like the New York women&rsquo;s. She hain&rsquo;t done one thing sence I
      come but haul out dresses an&rsquo; fixin&rsquo;s that used to belong to &rsquo;er dead
      mother, an&rsquo; try &rsquo;em on me, an&rsquo; they&rsquo;ve kept me on the move tell I&rsquo;d give a
      sight fer jest one little nap whar thar wasn&rsquo;t so much clatter. Last night
      they give me a old woman&rsquo;s party. Joel, jest think of a person o&rsquo; my age
      a-settin&rsquo; up tell &lsquo;leven o&rsquo;clock talkin&rsquo; to a gang o&rsquo; gray-haired women
      like a passel o&rsquo; hens jest off the&rsquo;r nests! An&rsquo; jest when I &lsquo;lowed they
      was all goin&rsquo; home, Sally passed around things to eat an&rsquo; drink.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They wanted to make you have a good time,&rdquo; ventured the storekeeper.
    </p>
    <p>
      The widow lowered her voice, and threw a furtive glance toward the
      dining-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it ain&rsquo;t the way to make a woman o&rsquo; my raisin&rsquo; enjoy a visit,&rdquo; she
      said, cautiously. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t dare to say a word, fer Amos seems tickled to
      death over all that Sally gits up; but, Joel, I&rsquo;m mighty nigh dead. Like a
      born idiot, I told &rsquo;em in my last letter that I&rsquo;d stay three months, an&rsquo;
      now, as the Lord is my help an&rsquo; stay, I don&rsquo;t believe I can make out
      another week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her voice faltered. Moisture glistened in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope it ain&rsquo;t as bad as that,&rdquo; remarked Joel, in a tone of vast
      sympathy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s jest awful,&rdquo; whimpered the widow. &ldquo;I make so many fool blunders.
      &lsquo;Tother day they wanted me to go to Brooklyn with &lsquo;em, an&rsquo; I jest lied out
      o&rsquo; goin&rsquo;; an&rsquo; as they wanted to take the hired gal along to watch the
      baby, I agreed to stay at home an&rsquo; &lsquo;tend to the house. My Lord, Joel, ef
      you&rsquo;ve never been alone in one o&rsquo; these contraptions, don&rsquo;t you ever try
      it. The hired gal showed me all the different arrangements, an&rsquo; what I was
      to do. When the bell in the back rings you must press the button in the
      kitchen, an&rsquo; when the bell in the front rings, it&rsquo;s somebody at the side
      door in the hall. An&rsquo; when you hear a shrill whistle out &rsquo;n the
      talkin&rsquo;-tube in the kitchen, you have to open the end an&rsquo; blow an&rsquo; then
      holler through an&rsquo; ax what&rsquo;s wanted. Then ef it&rsquo;s groceries, ur milk, ur
      peddlers&rsquo; stuff, ur what not, you have to go to the dumb-waiter that
      fetches things up through a hole in the wall like a well-bucket an&rsquo; take
      the things off. I had a lots o&rsquo; trouble. I was busy all the while the
      family was off at that dumb-waiter. Like a born fool, I didn&rsquo;t know it tuk
      stuff to other folks, too, an&rsquo; I thought it would save time to set at the
      dumb-waiter with the door open, an&rsquo; take off the things without waitin&rsquo;
      fer &rsquo;em to whistle. You never seed the like in all yore life! Before I&rsquo;d
      been thar a hour, the kitchen was liter&rsquo;ly filled with all manner o&rsquo;
      stuff, beer, bad-smellin&rsquo; cheese, and oodlin&rsquo;s an&rsquo; oodlin&rsquo;s o&rsquo; milk in
      bottles. After a while I heerd a fearful racket inside the dumb-waiter.
      People all the way to the top was a-yellin&rsquo; out that somebody had stole
      the&rsquo;r things, and the landlord was a-bouncin&rsquo; about like a rubber ball,
      an&rsquo; talkin&rsquo; of callin&rsquo; in the police. Finally he come in an&rsquo; axed me about
      it. He fixed it all right fer me, and delivered the goods to their
      rightful owners, an&rsquo; promised not to tell Amos nur Sally what I&rsquo;d done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You did sorter have a time of it,&rdquo; said Joel. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m no hand myse&rsquo;f to
      understand new fixin&rsquo;s. It&rsquo;s been chilly the last day or so, an&rsquo; when I
      went to my room in the tavern t&rsquo;other night I noticed that it was powerful
      warm after I went to bed. I got up an&rsquo; struck a light, but thar wasn&rsquo;t a
      sign of a fireplace in the room, an&rsquo; it was so hot I &lsquo;lowed thar might be
      a conflagration a-smolderin&rsquo; som &lsquo;ers. So I put on my things an&rsquo; went down
      to the office. They explained to me that the heat comes frum a furnace
      below, an&rsquo; runs into the rooms through holes in the floor. They come up
      an&rsquo; shet mine off so as I could sleep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a heap nicer our way,&rdquo; said the widow, without a smile at his
      misadventure. &ldquo;I tell you, Joel, I jest can&rsquo;t stand it. I want to go back.
      When are you a-goin&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the mornin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She fumbled in the pocket of her skirt and took out her handkerchief,
      placing it to her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m heartily sick of it all!&rdquo; she whimpered. &ldquo;You are the fust rail
      natural thing I&rsquo;ve laid eyes on sence I come. Sally is mighty cleanly, an&rsquo;
      I&rsquo;d ax you to clean the mud off &rsquo;n yore feet, but it&rsquo;s the fust muddy feet
      I&rsquo;ve seen in so long I want to look at &lsquo;em.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Joel glanced down at his boots and flushed. &ldquo;I never noticed &lsquo;em,&rdquo; he
      stammered. &ldquo;I had sech a time a-gittin&rsquo; in this shebang.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord, it don&rsquo;t matter, Joel! I&rsquo;m jest a-thinkin&rsquo; about you a-goin&rsquo; home.
      I simply cayn&rsquo;t stand it; an&rsquo; yet Amos an&rsquo; Sally would feel bad ef I went
      so soon. Amos was sayin&rsquo; last night that they would make me have sech a
      good time that I&rsquo;d never want to leave &lsquo;em; but la me! this is the fust
      rail work I&rsquo;ve done in many a day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I must go, I reckon,&rdquo; Joel said, rising awkwardly and taking his
      hat from the floor by his chair. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, too, to go back an&rsquo; leave you
      feelin&rsquo; so miserable. I wish I could do some &lsquo;n&rsquo; to comfort you, but I
      can&rsquo;t, I reckon. Good-bye&mdash;take keer of yorese&rsquo;f.&rdquo;

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>hen he arrived
      home two days later, Betsey found him, as she thought, peculiarly reticent
      about his trip, and all her efforts to get him to speak of how Mrs. Gibbs
      was pleased were fruitless. One afternoon two weeks after his return she
      ran into his store, where he was busy weighing smoked bacon which he was
      purchasing from a customer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What you reckon, Joel?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;What you reckon has happened?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he said, looking up from the paper on which he was
      figuring.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mis&rsquo; Gibbs&rsquo;s got back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You cayn&rsquo;t mean it, sister!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Betsey leaned against the counter, and the hardware in the showcase
      rattled. Joel&rsquo;s face had paled. He called his clerk to him, and told him
      to settle with the customer, and walked to the door with Betsey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;She got home in Jeff Woods&rsquo;s hack about a hour ago. All
      the neighbors is over there now. She acts so quar! She hain&rsquo;t seemed to
      keer a speck about the cow, nur the cat, nur the chickens. As soon as she
      got &rsquo;er things off, she jest sot down an&rsquo; drooped. She don&rsquo;t look well.
      The general opinion is that Amos an&rsquo; his wife have sent &rsquo;er home, fer she
      won&rsquo;t talk about them. She acts mighty funny. Jest as I started out I
      happened to remark that you&rsquo;d be astonished to heer she was back, an&rsquo; I
      never seed sech a quar look in a body&rsquo;s face. But,&rdquo; she concluded after a
      pause, &ldquo;they couldn&rsquo;t &lsquo;a&rsquo; treated &rsquo;er so awful bad, fer she&rsquo;s got dead
      loads o&rsquo; finery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That night Joel closed up his store earlier than usual, and when he came
      into the sitting-room he brought an armful of big logs and put them in the
      chimney. Then before a roaring fire he sat reflectively, without reading
      the paper he had brought with him, as was his wont. Betsey sat in the
      chimney-corner knitting, and looking first at him and then peering through
      the window toward Mrs. Gibbs&rsquo;s cottage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Brother Joel,&rdquo; she said, suddenly. &ldquo;You are a-actin&rsquo; quar, too. You must
      know some &lsquo;n&rsquo; about what happened to Mis&rsquo; Gibbs, ur why don&rsquo;t you go over
      thar an&rsquo; see &rsquo;er like the rest o&rsquo; the neighbors? They&rsquo;ve all been but you.
      She &rsquo;ll think strange of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see what good I could do,&rdquo; he answered; and he began to punch the
      fire, causing a stream of sparks to mount upward with a fusillade of tiny
      explosions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Betsey knitted silently for a few minutes longer, then she rose and stood
      at the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s got &rsquo;er lamp on the table an&rsquo; a paper in &rsquo;er lap, but she hain&rsquo;t
      a-readin&rsquo; of it,&rdquo; said Betsey. &ldquo;It looks jest like she&rsquo;s a-goin&rsquo; to
      commence &rsquo;er lonely broodin&rsquo; life over ag&rsquo;in. Some &lsquo;n&rsquo; seems wrong with
      &lsquo;er, as good an&rsquo; sweet as she is. She kinder fancied she&rsquo;d be happy with
      Amos, an&rsquo; mebby when she got &rsquo;im with &rsquo;er she begun to pine fer her ole
      home. Now she&rsquo;s back, an&rsquo; I reckon she hardly knows what she does want. I
      say, perhaps that may be her fix.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mebby it is,&rdquo; admitted the storekeeper, briefly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Betsey turned on him quickly. There was a peculiar aggressive sparkle in
      her eyes, a set look of determination on her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Brother Joel,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve jest got to have a grain of common
      sense. You&rsquo;ve got to go over thar this minute an&rsquo; see &lsquo;er. Ef you don&rsquo;t
      she ain&rsquo;t a-goin&rsquo; to sleep a wink. I know women, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ve knowed Mis&rsquo;
      Gibbs a long time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Joel drew his feet from the fire and wedged his heels under the rung of
      his chair. The muscles of his face were twitching. There was no mistaking
      Betsey&rsquo;s tone. She sat down near him and laid her thin, tremulous hand on
      his knee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do as I tell you, brother. Don&rsquo;t be back&rsquo;ard. You can&rsquo;t hide nothin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Joel rose. He tried to smile indifferently as he went to a little mirror
      on the wall and brushed his hair and beard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must wish me good luck, then, sister,&rdquo; he said, huskily. &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t no
      ways shore what she will do about me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After he had gone out Betsey took up an album and opened it at a
      collection of tintype pictures. On one of these her eyes rested long and
      mistily. Then she kissed it, wiped her eyes, and went to bed. Two hours
      later she heard the front door close and her brother creeping to his room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Joel!&rdquo; she called out. &ldquo;Come to my door a minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His boots made a loud clatter in the dead stillness of the house, as he
      approached.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was it all right, brother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You bet it was, Betsey!&rdquo; He stood in the doorway. The darkness hid his
      face, but there was a note of boundless joy in his tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought it would be, but I don&rsquo;t yet understand why she come back so
      quick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She don&rsquo;t like city folks&rsquo; ways,&rdquo; answered the storekeeper; &ldquo;an&rsquo; then&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An&rsquo; then what?&rdquo; broke in Betsey, impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you see, the&mdash;the notion seemed to strike both of us when we
      was travelin&rsquo; together, an&rsquo;&mdash;an&rsquo; she admitted that she was a leetle
      grain afeered that ef we didn&rsquo;t see one another ag&rsquo;in fer three months
      that the notion might wear off. Railly, she&rsquo;s tickled to death, fur now
      she says she kin give Amos an&rsquo; Sally a sensible reason fer wantin&rsquo; to git
      back home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Betsey was silent so long that Joel began to wonder if she had fallen
      asleep. Finally she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go to bed now, Joel. She&rsquo;s the very woman fer you. I hain&rsquo;t never had no
      rail happiness in my life sence Jim died, but I want them I love to git
      all they kin.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      JIM TRUNDLE&rsquo;S CRISIS
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>hey were expecting
      Jim Trundle at the Cross-Roads that spring morning. His coming had been
      looked for even more anxiously than that of Sid Wombley, the wag of the
      &ldquo;Cove.&rdquo; Sid himself, when he dragged his long legs into the store, forgot
      to think of anything amusing to say as he looked the crowd over to see if
      Jim had preceded him.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was on the end of his tongue to ask if Trundle had come and gone, but
      for once he said nothing. He seated himself on the head of a soda-keg and
      began to whittle the edge of the counter. Sid Wombley, quiet, suited the
      humor of the group better on this occasion than the same voluble
      individual in his natural element, so no one spoke to him, and all
      continued to watch the road leading to Trundle&rsquo;s cabin.
    </p>
    <p>
      The silence and the delay were too much for the patience of Wade Sims, a
      bold, dashing young man in tight-fitting trousers, sharp-heeled boots, and
      a sombrero like an unroped tent. He was, as he often expressed it, &ldquo;afraid
      o&rsquo; nothin&rsquo; under a hide,&rdquo; and if &ldquo;the boys&rdquo; had seen fit to give Jim
      Trundle notification, in the shape of a letter he would shortly receive,
      that he was a disgrace to the community, he saw no reason for so much
      secrecy. He wasn&rsquo;t afraid of the verdict of any jury that could be
      impaneled in the three counties over which he openly traded horses and
      secretly disposed of illicit whisky.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon thar&rsquo;s no doubt about the letter bein&rsquo; ready fer &lsquo;im,&rdquo; he
      remarked to Alf Carden, who stood in the little pigeon-holed pen of
      upright palings which was known as &ldquo;the postoffice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon not,&rdquo; was the reply, &ldquo;when it&rsquo;s about the only letter I got on
      hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could make a mighty good guess who drapped it,&rdquo; said Sims, with a grin
      at a one-armed man who had once held the position of book-keeper at a
      cotton-gin, and who wrote letters and legal documents for half the
      illiterate community, &ldquo;but I wouldn&rsquo;t give &rsquo;im away if I was under oath.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have an idee who&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to drap it,&rdquo; spoke up Sid Wombley from his
      soda-keg, and his sudden return to his natural condition evoked the first
      laugh of the morning. At that moment a little boy, the son of the
      storekeeper, who had been playing on the porch, came in quickly. His words
      and manner showed that he knew who was in request, if his intellect could
      not grasp the reason for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Trundle is comin&rsquo; acrost the cotton-patch behind the store,&rdquo; he
      announced, out of breath. Then silence fell on the group, a silence so
      complete that Jim Trundle&rsquo;s strides over the plowed ground outside were
      distinctly heard. The next moment Trundle had crawled over the low rail
      fence at the side of the store, and with clattering, untied brogans was
      coming up the steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doorway, as his tall, lank figure passed through it, framed a perfect
      picture of human poverty. His shirt, deeply dyed with the red of the soil,
      was full of slits and patches worn threadbare. The hems of his trousers
      had worn away, revealing triangular glimpses of his ankles, and a frayed
      piece of a suspender hung from a stout peg in the waistband behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      He greeted no one as he entered. A silent tongue was one of Jim Trundle&rsquo;s
      peculiarities. Few people had ever gotten a dozen consecutive words out of
      him. He strode to the end of the store, thrust his hand into an open
      cracker-box, bit into a large square cracker, and sent his eyes foraging
      along both counters for something to eat with it&mdash;cheese, butter, a
      bit of honey, or a pinch of dried beef. He was violating no rule of
      country store etiquette, for Alf Carden&rsquo;s customers all understood that
      those things left on the counters were to be partaken of in moderation. I
      think the habituÃ©s of the place had gradually introduced this custom
      themselves years before, when Carden was so anxious to draw people from
      the store across the river that he would willingly have given a customer
      bed and board for an indefinite time if by so doing he could have deprived
      his rival of the profit on a bag of salt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jim Trundle wasn&rsquo;t going to ask if there was any mail for him, that was
      plain to the curious onlookers; and their glances began to play back and
      forth between Carden and the cracker consumer, making demands on the
      former and condemning the latter for not more readily walking into the
      trap set for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wade Sims winked when he caught the storekeeper&rsquo;s eye, and nodded toward
      the gaunt robber, who had squatted at the faucet of a syrup-barrel and was
      cautiously trailing a golden stream over an immaculate cracker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you didn&rsquo;t git no letter fer me, Alf,&rdquo; said Sims, significantly.
      &ldquo;Seems like no mail don&rsquo;t come this way here lately hardly at all. I hope
      all the rest &rsquo;ll have their ride fer nothin&rsquo; too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Alf Carden understood, having given Sims a letter half an hour before, and
      he smiled. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;thar hain&rsquo;t nothin&rsquo; fer any of you except Jim
      Trundle; has he come along yet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jim stood up quickly, and laid his besmeared cracker on the barrel. &ldquo;Me?&rdquo;
       he ejaculated, and a white puff shot from his crunching jaws; &ldquo;I&mdash;I
      reckon yo &lsquo;re mistaken.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon I kin read,&rdquo; replied Carden, still acting his part nonchalantly,
      and glancing askance at Sims to see how that individual was taking it. &ldquo;It
      is jest Jim Trundle in plain ABC letters. It is either from somebody that
      cayn&rsquo;t write shore &rsquo;nough writin&rsquo; ur is tryin&rsquo; to disguise his handwrite.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carden threw the letter on the counter. It lay there fully a minute, while
      Jim Trundle wiped his hands on his trousers, gulped down a mouthful of
      cracker, and stared helplessly round at the upturned faces. Then he
      reached for the letter, and with trembling fingers tore it open and read
      as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>&ldquo;Jim Trundle. This is to give you due notice. We the reglar organized
      band of Regulators of this settlement hav set on yore case an decided what
      we are goin to do about it. Time and agin good citizens have advised you
      to change yore way of livin&rsquo;, but you jest went along as before, in the
      same old rut.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>&ldquo;You are no earthly account, an no amount of talkin seems to do you any
      good. Yore childern are in tatters an without food, an you jest wont do
      nothin fer them. This might hav gone on longer without our action, but
      last Wednesday you let yore sick wife go to the field in the hot brilin
      sun, an she was seed by a responsible citizen in a faintin condition,
      while you was on the creek banks a fishin in the shade.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>&ldquo;To night exactly at eight oclock we are comin after you in full force
      to give you a sound lickin. Yore wife an childern would be better off
      without you, and we advise you to leave the country before that time. If
      we find you at home at eight oclock you may count on a sore back.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Yours truly, the secretary.&rdquo;</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      The spectators observed that Jim Trundle had read every word of the
      communication. His eyes, in their sunken sockets, darted strange, hunted
      glances from face to face, as if seeking sympathy; then, as if realizing
      the futility of the hope, he looked down at the floor. He leaned back
      against the counter so heavily that Carden&rsquo;s thread-case rattled its
      contents and the beam of the scales wildly swung back and forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      The group furtively feasted themselves on his visible agony, but they got
      nothing more, for Jim Trundle did not intend to talk. Talking was not in
      his line. He knew that at eight o&rsquo;clock that night he was going to be
      punished in a way that would be remembered against the third and fourth
      generation of his descendants&mdash;that is, if he did not desert his
      family and leave the country.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kin I do anything fer you in the provision line, Jim?&rdquo; asked Carden, for
      the entertainment of his customers. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got some fresh bulk pork. Seems
      to me you hain&rsquo;t had none lately.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Trundle refused to answer. He only stared out into the golden sunshine
      that lay on the road to his home. He saw through Carden&rsquo;s remarks, and his
      heart felt heavier under the thought that before him were some of the
      faces which would be masked later on. He wondered if those men knew that a
      lazy, worthless vagabond could feel disgrace as keenly as they could.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was nothing left for him to do except to go home. He wanted to turn
      his mind-pictures of his wife and children into helpful realities. Somehow
      they had always comforted him in trouble. Oh, God! if only he could have
      foreseen the approach of this calamity! As he moved out of the store he
      felt vaguely as if his arms, legs, and body had nothing to do with his
      real, horrible self except to hinder it, to detain it near its spot of
      torture.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside he drew a long, deep, trembling breath. His breast rose and
      expanded under his ragged shirt and then sank like a collapsed balloon,
      and lay still while he thought of himself. He was a dead man alive, a
      moving, breathing horror in the sight of mankind.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was sure that it was his strange nature that had brought him to it.
      Nature had, indeed, made him happy in rags, oblivious to material things.
      Had he been endowed with education he might have become a poet. He saw
      strange, transcendent possibilities in the blue skies; in the green
      growing things; in the dun heights of the mountains; in the depths of his
      children&rsquo;s eyes; in the patient face of his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      What an awakening! A shudder ran over him. He felt the lash; he heard Wade
      Sim&rsquo;s voice of command; then his lower lip began to quiver, and something
      rising within him forced tears into his eyes. He had begun to pity
      himself. If only those men really understood him they would pardon his
      shortcomings. No human being could knowingly lash a man feeling as he
      felt.
    </p>
    <p>
      The road homeward led him into the depths of a wood where mighty trees
      arched overhead and obscured the sky. He envied a squirrel bounding
      unhindered to its sylvan home. Nature seemed to hold out her vast green
      arms to him; he wanted to sink into them and sob away the awful load that
      lay upon him. In the deepest part of the wood, where tall, rugged cliffs
      bordered the road, there was a spring. He paused, looked round him, and
      shuddered anew, for something told him it was at this secluded spot that
      he would receive his castigation.
    </p>
    <p>
      He passed on. The trees grew less dense along the way, and then on a rise
      ahead of him he saw his cabin, a low, weather-beaten structure that melted
      into the brown plowed fields about it. He was anxious to see his wife.
      Could it be true that she had almost fainted while at work? If so, why had
      she not mentioned it to him? He had noted nothing unusual in her conduct
      of late; but how could he? She was as uncommunicative as he, and they
      seldom talked to each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he passed the pig-sty in the fence-corner even the sight of the
      grunting inmate seemed to remind him that he was going to be whipped by
      his neighbors. He shuddered and felt his blood grow cold. He shuddered
      with the same thought again, as if he were encountering it for the first
      time, when he dragged open the sagging gate and looked about the bare
      yard. In one corner of it he had once started to grow some flowers, but
      his neighbors had laughed at his attempt so much that he allowed the bulbs
      to die and be uprooted by his chickens. His mind now reverted to that
      period, and he decided it was this and kindred impulses that had always
      kept him from being a good husband, father, and citizen like his sturdy,
      more practical neighbors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, to-morrow he was going to turn over a new leaf&mdash;that is, if&mdash;but
      he could not look beyond the torture set for eight o&rsquo;clock. He had
      imagination, but it could picture nothing but every possible detail of his
      approaching degradation&mdash;the secluded spot, the masked circle of men,
      a muffled talk by Wade Sims, the baring of his back,&mdash;the lash!
    </p>
    <p>
      His wife was in the cabin. She held a wooden bowl in her lap and was
      shelling peas. As he towered up in front of her in the low-roofed room,
      for the first time in his life he noticed that she looked pale and thin,
      and as he continued to study the evidences against him in growing
      bewilderment he felt that even God had deserted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; she asked, in slow surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothin&rsquo;.&rdquo; But he continued to stare. How thin her hair seemed since she
      had recovered from the fever! Perhaps if he had insisted on having a
      doctor something might have been done for her then that was neglected.
      Poor Martha! how he had made her suffer! The whipping would not be so hard
      to bear now, except that&mdash;if she were to know&mdash;if she were to
      witness it. Ah, he had not thought of that! Yes, God had left him wholly
      at the mercy of Wade Sims and the rest of his neighbors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes held a look of deep concern.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you lookin&rsquo; at me that-a-way fer?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      He made no answer, but turned to a stool in the chimney-corner and sat
      down. She must not suspect what was going to happen. He would not escape
      it by deserting her, for he was going to be a better man, beginning with
      the next day. He would stay with her and protect her, but she must never
      hear of the whipping. He understood her proud spirit well enough to know
      that she could never get over such a disgrace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then out of the black flood of his despair a plan rose and floated into
      possibility before his mind&rsquo;s eye. Sims&rsquo; men would gather at the store,
      and just before the appointed hour would march along the road he had just
      traversed. He would make some excuse to his wife for being obliged to
      absent himself for a little while and go to meet them. If he told them he
      had voluntarily come to be whipped, they might agree to keep the fact from
      his wife. Yes, God would not let them refuse that, for even Wade Sims
      would not want to pain an unoffending woman when he was told how Martha
      would take it. Then a sob broke from him, and he realized that his head
      had fallen between his knees, that tears were dripping from his eyes to
      his hands, and, moreover, that Martha was looking at him as she had never
      looked before. She wanted to ask him what was the matter, but she could
      not have done it to save her life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you ready fer dinner?&rdquo; she asked, still with that look in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I reckon, ef&mdash;ef you are. Whar&rsquo;s the children?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Behind the house, hoein&rsquo; the young corn. Do you want &lsquo;em?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; jest thought I&rsquo;d ask.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She emptied the peas from her apron into the bowl, and put it on a shelf.
      Then she walked across the swaying puncheon floor to a little cupboard,
      and began to busy her hands with some dishes, keeping furtive eyes the
      while on him. He evidently thought himself unobserved, for he allowed his
      head to fall dejectedly again, and stared fixedly at the hearth. Surely,
      thought Mrs. Trundle, Jim had never acted so peculiarly before. Wiping a
      plate with a dishcloth, she moved across the floor till she stood in front
      of him. He looked up. The gleaming orbs in their deep hollows frightened
      the woman into speech she might not have indulged in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look y&rsquo; heer, Jim, has anythin&rsquo; gone wrong?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo; He drew himself up, and rubbed his eyes. &ldquo;Did you say dinner was
      ready?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know the table hain&rsquo;t set. Look y&rsquo; heer, are you sick, Jim Trundle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo; His eyes rested on her. There was much that he wanted to ask her, if
      only he could have found the words. She turned away unsatisfied. The next
      moment she fanned him with the cloth she was spreading for the meal, then
      she put a plate of fried bacon and a pan of corn bread on the table, went
      to the back door, and called the children from their work.
    </p>
    <p>
      He studied them one by one with fresh horror as they filed in, wondering
      what this one or that one would think if they should learn that their
      father had been whipped for neglecting them and their mother. At the
      table, however, he studied his wife chiefly. The children were young and
      healthy, and devoured their food like famished animals, but she was only
      making feeble pretenses with the piece of bread she was daintily breaking
      and dipping into bacon-grease. The &ldquo;Regulators,&rdquo; as they called
      themselves, were right; he had allowed a sick wife to go into the hot sun
      to do work he ought to have done. He thought now of the lash again, but
      not with a shudder. It could never pain him more than the agony at his
      heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      He spent that long afternoon under an apple-tree behind the cabin, mending
      a harrow that was broken, stealing glances at his wife, longing to open
      his heart to her, watching the progress of the sun in its slow descent to
      the mountain-top, and feeling the threatening chill of the lengthening
      shadows. All nature seemed mutely to announce the coming horror. At
      sundown he went to the shelf in the entry, filled a tin pan with fresh
      spring-water, and washed his face and hands. Then he went in to supper,
      but he did not eat heartily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you feel no better, Jim?&rdquo; asked his wife, her manner softened by a
      vague uneasiness his actions had roused. A suggestion of his mute
      suppressed agony seemed to have reached her and drawn her nearer to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I hain&rsquo;t sick; I &rsquo;ll be all right in the mornin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Through the open door he watched the darkness thicken and heard the
      insects of the night begin to chirp and shrill. He had the curse of
      introspective analysis, and resolved that they were happy. He used to
      whistle and sing himself when his youth rendered it excusable. How very
      long ago that seemed!
    </p>
    <p>
      All at once he rose, pretended to yawn, and said something to his wife
      about going over to Rawlston&rsquo;s a little while; he would be back by
      bedtime. She wondered in silence, and after he had passed through the gate
      she tiptoed to the door and looked after him uneasily.
    </p>
    <p>
      The landscape darkened as he went along the road toward Carden&rsquo;s store. It
      was quite dark in the wooded vale. When he reached the spring he stopped
      to await the coming of Wade Sims and his followers. He wondered if the
      spot was far enough from the cabin to prevent Martha from hearing the
      blows that were to fall. He hoped it was, and, more than anything else,
      that &ldquo;the regulators&rdquo; would not be drinking. They would be more apt to
      listen to his request if they were perfectly sober. The rising moon in the
      direction of the store now made the arched roadway look like a long
      tunnel.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would soon be eight o&rsquo;clock. He sat down on the root of a tree and
      tried to pray, but no prayer he had ever heard would come into the chaos
      of his mind, and he could not invent one to suit the occasion. By and by
      he heard voices down the road, then the tramp, tramp of footsteps. A dark
      blur appeared on the moonlit roadway at the mouth of the tunnel, and grew
      gradually into a body of men.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jim Trundle stood up. They should find him ready.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello! what have we heer?&rdquo; It was the undisguised voice of Wade Sims. The
      gang of twenty men or more paused abruptly. There was a hurried fitting on
      of white cloth masks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s thar?&rdquo; called out the same voice, peremptorily, and the hammer of a
      revolver clicked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me&mdash;Jim Trundle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; Wade&rsquo;s grunt of surprise was echoed in various exclamations round
      the group. &ldquo;On yore way out &rsquo;n the county, eh? Seems to me yore time&rsquo;s up.
      We &rsquo;ll have to put it to a vote. It&rsquo;s a little past eight o&rsquo;clock, an&rsquo;
      you&rsquo;ve had the whole day to git a move on you. Whar you bound fer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t on my way nowhar. I come down heer a half-hour ago to meet
      you-uns, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ve jest been a-waitin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To meet we-uns? Huh! Jeewhilikins!&rdquo; It sounded like Alf Carden&rsquo;s voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I &lsquo;lowed you-uns would likely want to do it heer, bein&rsquo; as it was
      whar you-uns tuck Joe Rand last fall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Silence fell&mdash;a silence so profound, so susceptible, that it seemed
      to retain Trundle&rsquo;s words and hold them up to sight rather than to hearing
      for fully half a minute after they had ceased to stir the air. Even Wade
      Sim&rsquo;s blustering equipose was shaken. His mask appealed helplessly to
      other masks, but their jagged eye-holes offered no helpful suggestions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we are much obleeged to you,&rdquo; said Wade, awkwardly; and he laughed
      a laugh that went little farther than his mask. &ldquo;Boys, he looks like he&rsquo;s
      actu&rsquo;ly itchin&rsquo; fer it; you needn&rsquo;t feel at all squeamish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been studyin&rsquo; over it,&rdquo; said Trundle, furnishing more surprise, &ldquo;and
      I&rsquo;ve concluded that I ort to be whipped, an&rsquo; that sound. In fact,
      neighbors, the sooner you do it an&rsquo; have it over the better I &rsquo;ll feel
      about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The silence that swallowed up this clear-cut assertion was deeper than the
      one which had followed Trundle&rsquo;s other remark. Seeing that no one was
      ready to reply, he went on, &ldquo;I did come down heer, though, to see ef I
      couldn&rsquo;t git you-uns to do me a sorter favor, ef you-uns jest would.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; Wade Sims was feeling better. &ldquo;I must say I was puzzled about yore
      conduct in sa &lsquo;nterin&rsquo; out to meet us. Well, what do you want?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m ready fer my whippin&rsquo;,&rdquo; said Trundle, &ldquo;becase I think I deserve it.
      I&rsquo;ve been so lazy an&rsquo; careless that I never once noticed till I got yore
      letter that my wife was a sick woman. I <i>did</i> let her go to the field
      in the hot sun when I was a-fishin&rsquo; on the creek-bank in the shade. I
      thought her an&rsquo; all of us would like some fresh fish, an&rsquo; I forgot that
      our corn-patch was sufferin&rsquo; fer the hoe. But she didn&rsquo;t. She &lsquo;tended to
      it. An&rsquo;&mdash;now I come to the favor I want to ask. She hain&rsquo;t done a
      speck o&rsquo; harm to you-uns, an&rsquo;, as foolish as it may seem, it would go hard
      with her in her weakly condition to heer about me a-goin&rsquo; through what I
      &rsquo;ll have to submit to. She has got a mighty sight of pride, an&rsquo; it&rsquo;s my
      honest conviction that she would jest pine away an&rsquo; die ef she knowed
      about it. I ain&rsquo;t a-beggin&rsquo; off from nothin&rsquo;, understand; it&rsquo;s only a word
      fer her an&rsquo; the childern. You kin all take a turn an&rsquo; whip me jest as long
      as you want to, but when it&rsquo;s over an&rsquo; done with I &lsquo;lowed you mought
      consent to say nothin&rsquo; to nobody about it. Besides, I&rsquo;ve made up my mind
      to lead a different sort of a life, friends, God bein&rsquo; my helper, an&rsquo; it
      would be easier to do it if I knowed Martha had respect fer me; an&rsquo;,
      neighbors, I am actu&rsquo;ly afeered she won&rsquo;t have it if she diskivers what
      takes place to-night. I&mdash;I think you-uns mought agree to that much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Masks turned upon masks. Some of them fell from strangely set visages into
      hands that quivered and failed to replace them. It was plain to the crowd
      that they had not elected a leader who could possibly do justice to the
      infinite delicacy of the situation. In fact, something was struggling in
      Wade Sims that was humiliating him in his own eyes, making him feel
      decidedly unmanly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think yore proposition is&mdash;is purty reasonable,&rdquo; he managed to
      blurt out, after an awkward hesitation. &ldquo;We hain&rsquo;t none of us got nothin&rsquo;
      ag&rsquo;in yore wife; an&rsquo; ef she is sick, an&rsquo; hearin&rsquo; about this&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But his inability to continue was evident to his most sincere admirers.
      Trundle sighed in relief. He knew that not one in the gang could possibly
      be harder of heart than their blustering leader. &ldquo;I wish, then,
      gentlemen,&rdquo; he said, calmly, &ldquo;that you&rsquo;d git it over with. I don&rsquo;t know
      how long it&rsquo;s a-goin&rsquo; to take&mdash;that&rsquo;s with you-uns; but Martha thinks
      I&rsquo;ve gone over to Rawlston&rsquo;s to set till bedtime, an&rsquo; it &rsquo;ll soon be time
      I was back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a fact,&rdquo; admitted Wade Sims, slowly, as if his mind were on
      something besides the business in hand, and he looked round him. The band
      stood like rugged, white-capped posts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then it was proved that Sid Wombley, the wag of the valley, had more
      courage of his convictions than had ever been accredited to him. It
      sounded strange to hear him speak without joking. His seriousness struck a
      sort of terror to the hearts of some of the most backward. There was a
      suspicion of a whimper in the tone he manfully tried to straighten as he
      spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Looky&rsquo; heer, Jim,&rdquo; he said, and he stepped forward and tore off his mask,
      I&rsquo;ve got a sorter feelin&rsquo; that I want you to see my face an&rsquo; know who I
      am. Sence I heard yore proposal, blame me ef I hain&rsquo;t got more downright
      respect fer you than fer any man in this cove, an&rsquo; I want to kick myself.
      You&rsquo;ve got the sort o&rsquo; meat in you that ain&rsquo;t in me, I&rsquo;m afeered, an&rsquo; I
      take off my hat to it. I&rsquo;m a member o&rsquo; this gang, an&rsquo; have agreed to abide
      by the vote of the majority, but they &rsquo;ll have to git a mighty move on
      theirselves an&rsquo; reverse the&rsquo;r decision in yore case, ur I &rsquo;ll be a
      deserter. I&rsquo;d every bit as soon whip my mammy as a body feelin&rsquo; like you
      do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the talk.&rdquo; It was the voice of Alf Carden. All at once he
      remembered that Jim Trundle, after all that had been said against him, did
      not owe him a cent, while nearly every other man present had to be dunned
      systematically once a week. &ldquo;Boys, let &rsquo;im go,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a-thinkin&rsquo;
      we hain&rsquo;t fully understood Jim Trundle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hain&rsquo;t the one that got up this movement,&rdquo; said Wade Sims, in a tone of
      defense. Where sentiment was concerned he was out of his element. &ldquo;Ef you
      was to let &rsquo;im off with a word of advice, it wouldn&rsquo;t be the fust time we
      conceded a p&rsquo;int.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That settled it. With vague mutterings of various sheepish kinds the crowd
      began to filter away. Some went down the road, and others took paths that
      led from it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sid Wombley lingered with Jim a moment. Not being able to turn the matter
      into a jest, and yet being a thorough man, he felt very awkward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on home, Jim,&rdquo; he said, gently, his hand on Trundle&rsquo;s arm. &ldquo;Your wife
      &rsquo;ll never know a thing about it; they &rsquo;ll all keep it quiet, an&rsquo; the boys
      &rsquo;ll never bother you ag&rsquo;in. I&mdash;I &rsquo;ll see to that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They shook hands. Trundle started to speak, but simply choked and coughed.
      Sid turned away. An idea for a joke flitted through his mind, but he
      discarded it as unworthy of the occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jim went slowly up the hill to his cabin. The moon was now higher up, and
      as he neared the gate he saw his wife walking about in the entry. She was
      not alone. A woman sat on the step. It was old Mrs. Samuel, the aunt of
      Wade Sims, a neighbor, who sometimes dropped in to spend the evening. Was
      it an exclamation of glad surprise that he heard as he opened the gate,
      and did his wife stand still and stare at him excitedly, or was the sound
      the voice of one of the children turning in its sleep? Was her cast of
      countenance a trick of the moonlight and shadows?
    </p>
    <p>
      The eyes of both women fell as he approached them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good evenin&rsquo;, Jim,&rdquo; was Mrs. Samuel&rsquo;s greeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      He nodded and sat down on the steps, his back to his wife. They were all
      silent. Mrs. Trundle stepped to the water-shelf at one side, and peered at
      his profile through the shadows, her face full of vague misgivings. Then
      she sat down in a chair behind him, and studied his back, his neck, the
      way his shirt lay, her hands clinched on her knees, the fury of a tiger in
      her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ten minutes passed. Then Trundle roused himself with a start. He must not
      be so absent-minded; they must suspect nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whar&rsquo;s the children?&rdquo; he asked, not looking toward his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In bed a hour ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her tone struck him dumb with apprehension. He stared over his shoulder at
      her. Her face was hidden in her hands. He glanced at the visitor, and saw
      her avert her eyes. Could she have heard of the plan to whip him, and
      revealed it to his wife? He felt sure of it; Wade Sims could not keep a
      secret. His wife thought he had been punished. No matter; it was the same
      thing. His heart was ice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Trundle bent nearer him. She was trying surreptitiously to see if
      there were any marks on his neck above his shirt-collar.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently her pent-up emotions seemed to overwhelm her. She began to sob
      and rock back and forth. Then she glared at Mrs. Samuel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d think you&rsquo;d have the decency to go home,&rdquo; she said, fiercely, &ldquo;an&rsquo;
      not set thar an&rsquo;&mdash;an&rsquo; gloat over me an&rsquo; him like a crow. It&rsquo;s our
      bedtime.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Martha, what&rsquo;s the&mdash;&rdquo; Trundle stood up in bewilderment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was jest gettin&rsquo; ready to go,&rdquo; stammered the visitor, humbly, and she
      hastened away. Trundle sank back on his seat. What was to be done now? He
      had never seen his wife that way, but he loved her more than ever in his
      life before. She watched Mrs. Samuel&rsquo;s form vanish in the hazy moonlight;
      then she sat down on the step beside her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jim,&rdquo; she faltered, &ldquo;I want you to lay yore head in my lap.&rdquo; She had put
      her thin, quivering arm round his neck, and her voice had never before
      held such tender, motherly cadences.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you want me to do that fer?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jest becase I do. I hain&rsquo;t never in all my life loved you like I do at
      this minute. I&rsquo;d fight fer you with my last breath; I&rsquo;d die fer you. Jim,
      poor, dear Jim! you needn&rsquo;t try to hide it from me. Mis&rsquo; Samuel had jest
      told me what the Regulators was goin&rsquo; to do when you turned the corner. I
      know you went down to the spring to meet &rsquo;em so me an&rsquo; the childern
      wouldn&rsquo;t know it. Many a man would &lsquo;a&rsquo; gone away an&rsquo; left his family
      ruther than suffer such disgrace. Oh, Jim, I&rsquo;d a million times ruther
      they&rsquo;d whipped me! I &rsquo;ll never git over it. I &rsquo;ll feel that lash on my
      back every minute as long as I live. They hain&rsquo;t none of &rsquo;em got sense
      enough to see what a good, lovin&rsquo; man you are at the bottom. I&rsquo;d ruther
      have you jest like you are than like any one o&rsquo; that layout. We must move
      away somewhars an&rsquo; begin all over. I don&rsquo;t want the childern to grow up
      under sech disgrace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her hand passed gently round to the front of his shirt. She unfastened it,
      and began to sob as she turned the garment down at the neck. &ldquo;Oh, Jim, did
      they hurt you? Does it&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They didn&rsquo;t tetch me, Martha,&rdquo; he said, finally recovering his voice.
      &ldquo;Sid Wombley kinder tuk pity on me an&rsquo; stood up fer me, an&rsquo; they all
      concluded to give me another trial. I hain&rsquo;t lived right, Martha, I kin
      see it now, an&rsquo; to-morrow I&rsquo;m a-goin&rsquo; to begin different. These fellows
      have got good hearts in &lsquo;em, an&rsquo; after the way they talked an&rsquo; acted
      to-night I hain&rsquo;t a-goin&rsquo; to harbor no ill-will ag&rsquo;in&rsquo; &lsquo;em.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Trundle leaned toward him. She began to cry softly, and he drew her
      head over on his shoulder and stroked her thin hair with his coarse hands.
      Then they kissed each other, went into the cabin, and went to bed in the
      dark, so as not to wake the children.

    <h2>
      THE COURAGE OF ERICSON
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>n straggling,
      despondent lines the men in soiled gray leaned on their muskets and peered
      through the misty darkness at the enemy crawling across the field in front
      of them like a monster reptile. The colonel of the regiment nearest the
      coppice of pines strode restlessly back and forth in front of his men, on
      tenter-hooks of anxiety, the spasmodic glow of his cigar showing features
      grim and tortured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I feel like we &lsquo;re in fer it to-night,&rdquo; whispered Private Ericson to a
      battle-stained comrade.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right you are,&rdquo; was the guarded reply; &ldquo;an&rsquo; we-uns ain&rsquo;t a handful beside
      the army out thar. I tell you the blasted fellers have had reinforcements
      sence the sun went down. I know it, an&rsquo; our colonel is beginnin&rsquo; to
      suspicion it. Ef he had his way he&rsquo;d order a retreat while thar&rsquo;s a
      chance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Silence, punctuated by the clanking of the colonel&rsquo;s sword and the snoring
      of a private asleep standing, intervened. Then Private Huckaby resumed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So this is raily yore old stompin&rsquo;-ground, Ericson. I reckon you uster
      haul pine-knots out &rsquo;n them woods, and split rails on that mountain-side.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know every inch of it like a book,&rdquo; sighed Ericson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An&rsquo; I reckon that sweetheart o&rsquo; yor &rsquo;n don&rsquo;t live fur off, ef she didn&rsquo;t
      refugee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her folks wuz Union,&rdquo; returned Ericson, sententiously. &ldquo;Her &rsquo;n tuk one
      side, an&rsquo; me an&rsquo; mine t&rsquo;other. The cabin she used to live in is jest
      beyond them woods at the foot o&rsquo; the fust mountain, &lsquo;Old Crow.&rsquo; She&rsquo;s thar
      yit. A feller that seed &rsquo;er a week ago told me. She &lsquo;lowed ef I jined the
      Confederacy I needn&rsquo;t ever look her way any more. Her father an&rsquo; only
      brother went to the Union side, an&rsquo; she blamed me fer wantin&rsquo; to go with
      my folks. She is as proud as Lucifer. I wisht we&rsquo;d parted friendlier. I
      hain&rsquo;t been in a single fight without wantin&rsquo; that one thing off my mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ericson leaned on the muzzle of his gun, and Huckaby saw his broad
      shoulders rise and quiver convulsively. He stared at the begrimed face
      under the slouched hat, beginning to think that what he had seen of his
      young mate had been only the surface&mdash;the froth&mdash;of a deeper
      nature. An excited grunt came from the mist which almost enveloped the
      colonel, and he was seen to dart to the end of the regiment and throw down
      his cigar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To arms!&rdquo; he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      The words were drowned in the clatter of muskets as they were snatched
      from the ground to horny palms. The sound died like the rustle of dead
      leaves in a forest after a gust of wind. A composite eye saw that the line
      which had been moving across the field in front had paused, steadied
      itself. The next instant it was a billow of flame half a mile in length,
      rolling up and dashing itself against the wall of damp darkness. The
      colonel, his blue steel blade raised against the sheet of piercing lead,
      sprang forward, a black silhouette against the enemy&rsquo;s glare. He meant it
      as an objective command&mdash;a prayer&mdash;to his men to stand to their
      ground, but he tottered, leaned on his sword, and as its point sank into
      the earth he fell face downward. Drums, great and small, boomed and
      rattled on the Confederate side like a prolonged echo of the Federal&rsquo;s
      salvo.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ranks of the Confederates wavered&mdash;broke; the retreat began.
      Running backward, his gun poised, Ericson felt a numb, tingling sensation
      in his right side. He turned and started after his comrades, but each step
      he put down seemed to meet the ground as it fell from him. Then he felt
      dizzy. There was a roaring in his ears, and his legs weakened. As he fell
      his gun tripped the feet of Huckaby, and that individual went to earth,
      and then on hands and knees, to avoid being shot, crept to his friend&rsquo;s
      side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong, Eric? Done fer?&rdquo; he asked, his tone weighty with the
      tragedy of the moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe so,&rdquo; said Ericson. &ldquo;Go on; don&rsquo;t wait!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-by, my boy,&rdquo; Huckaby said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d tote ye, but some &lsquo;n&rsquo; is the matter
      with the calf o&rsquo; my right leg. I&rsquo;d give out, I know, an&rsquo;&mdash;an&rsquo; I must
      remember my wife and the ba&mdash;&rdquo; He was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half an hour passed, during which time Ericson had experienced the
      delicious sensation of a man freezing to death, then a realization of his
      condition permeated his consciousness. He drew himself up on an elbow and
      glanced over the field. Black ambulances, like vultures stalking about
      with drooping wings, were picking their way among the dead and dying.
      Vaguely Ericson&rsquo;s numb fancy pictured himself being jostled like a human
      log of wood to hospital, or perhaps to prison, and grasping his musket,
      and transforming it into a crutch, he rose and hobbled away from the
      groans and puddles of blood into the edge of the wood.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had no sooner reached it than he felt the earth acting as if it were a
      mad sea again, and he sank headlong into the heather and underbrush. When
      he came to it was morning. The oblique rays of the sun were making
      diamonds and pearls of the poised dew-drops. The field had been cleared.
      Only a shattered gun, a tattered cap, a battered canteen bore evidence of
      the recent carnage. Half a mile across the level valley Ericson saw a
      village of tents, blue-coated guards pacing to and fro, and the stars and
      stripes rippling from a tall staff.
    </p>
    <p>
      The private rose cautiously to his trembling feet, and aided by his too
      weighty crutch he went slowly through the wood toward the cabin where
      dwelt Sally Tripp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the nighest house,&rdquo; he said to himself. &ldquo;Shorely she won&rsquo;t refuse to
      let me in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      However, when he had passed through the wood and saw the cabin not fifty
      yards from him in the open, a screw of blue smoke curling from the
      mud-and-stick chimney, misgivings which had depressed him ever since he
      had parted with her attacked him anew. He forgot that he had lost nearly
      every ounce of his life-blood, and stood almost erect, resting hardly the
      weight of his hand on the gun as his eyes drank in the familiar old scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he heard the massive bar of one of the doors squeak as it was lifted
      from its wooden sockets, and in the doorway stood a golden-haired vision.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank God, it&rsquo;s her!&rdquo; Ericson muttered; and the sight of her standing
      there, looking afar off toward the camp of the Federals, gave him courage.
      He dropped his gun, determined not to exhibit weakness, and walked
      erectly, if slowly, toward her.
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw the girl turn pale, stare at him steadily, and stifle a scream with
      her hand at her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know me, Sally?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stared mutely, inwardly occupied with her outward appearance, fearing
      perhaps that a tithe of her gladness of heart at seeing him might be
      detected by his supersensitive, pleading eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thar ain&rsquo;t nothin&rsquo; to keep me from knowin&rsquo; of you,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;As fur as
      them clothes on yore back is concerned, they become yore sort powerful
      well. A rebel is a rebel anywhar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again the qualms of physical weakness stirred within him. He hung his
      head, praying for strength to keep from falling at her feet. She smiled
      relentlessly and continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon when the Union men attackted you-uns last night you broke an&rsquo;
      ran like all the rest. I seed that fight, John Ericson. Me an&rsquo; grandpa
      scrouged down behind the chimney so as not to git struck an&rsquo; watched the
      trap the bluecoats was a-layin&rsquo; fer you-uns. We seed the reinforcements
      slide in round &lsquo;Old Crow&rsquo;, an&rsquo; knowed most o&rsquo; you-uns would play
      mumbly-peg &lsquo;fore mornin&rsquo;. I mought &lsquo;a&rsquo; &lsquo;lowed you&rsquo;d git off unteched,
      knowing them woods as well as you do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His silence, his downcast attitude may have shamed the girl, for a change
      came over her. She cast a hurried glance at the far-off encampment, and a
      touch of anxiety came into her tone as she added:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;d better git back into hidin&rsquo;, John Ericson. The Union soldiers have
      been sendin&rsquo; out searchin&rsquo; squads all day fer men that got aloose in the
      woods. They say they pulled Jake McLain right out &rsquo;n his bed. His wife had
      burnt his rebel uniform an&rsquo; said he was a Yank a-lyin&rsquo; up sick, but the
      powder-stains on his face give him away, an&rsquo; they tuk him off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was plain to him that she did not suspect he was wounded unto death,
      and he forgave her sternness for the sake of his great love. Besides, she
      was showing qualities of patriotism to which he granted her the right,
      though he could not comprehend what influence had entered her life to
      harden it to such an extent. Just then the bent form of Grandfather Tripp
      emerged from the other room of the cabin, crossed the entry, and stared at
      the soldier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I &rsquo;ll be liter&rsquo;ly bumfuzzled!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Ef it ain&rsquo;t John
      Ericson! I knowed yore company was in the fight last night, an&rsquo; I thought
      o&rsquo; you when I heerd the grape-shot a-plinkin&rsquo; out thar. But hang me, ef
      you don&rsquo;t look sick ur half starved! Sally, give &rsquo;im some &lsquo;n&rsquo; t&rsquo; eat. They
      don&rsquo;t feed the rebs much. Johnny, she&rsquo;s been a-pinin&rsquo; fer you ever sence
      you enlisted, an&rsquo; last night durin&rsquo; the fight she mighty nigh went
      distracted. She&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Grandpa, that&rsquo;s a lie!&rdquo; cried the girl, fiercely; but there were pink
      spots in her cheeks as she retreated into the cabin and began to slam the
      pots and pans on the stone hearth.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man caught the arm of the soldier. &ldquo;Go right in, my boy. She&rsquo;s
      that glad to see you unhurt she don&rsquo;t know what to do. She &rsquo;ll give you a
      mouthful gladder &rsquo;n she ever fed a Yank.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mounting the log steps to the cabin door seemed to deprive the soldier of
      the last vestige of his strength. As if from a distance he heard the
      girl&rsquo;s complaining voice, and a blur hung before his sight. Blindly he
      felt for a chair and sank into it. His head was sinking to his breast,
      when the sharp voice of the girl&mdash;sharper because of her
      grandfather&rsquo;s meddling&mdash;revived him like the lash of a whip on the
      back of a succumbing beast of burden.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pa&rsquo;s dead, John Ericson,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Shot down, fer all I know, by you.
      He&rsquo;s gone. Now I reckon you see why I don&rsquo;t like the looks o&rsquo; yore
      clothes. Then jest see heer.&rdquo; She flounced into a corner of the room,
      jerked a trunk open and brought to him the soiled uniform of a Federal
      soldier. &ldquo;This was what Brother Jasper had on when he died. That hole in
      the breast is where the ball went in. He come home a week ago on a
      furlough to git over his wound, an&rsquo; died a-settin&rsquo; thar in that door. Do
      you wonder that I never want to lay eyes on a dirty gray coat again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ericson&rsquo;s slouched hat hid the piteous glare in his eyes. He rested his
      two hands on the arms of the chair and tried to draw himself up, but that
      effort was the signal for his collapse. The girl laid the uniform on the
      table and stared at him, the lines of her face softening and betraying
      vague disquietude.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look a heer,&rdquo; she blurted out, suddenly, &ldquo;are&mdash;are you wounded?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He tried to speak, but his lips seemed paralyzed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My God! Grandpa, look!&rdquo; the girl cried. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s wounded! He&rsquo;s dying, an&rsquo;
      I&rsquo;ve jest been a-standin&rsquo; heer&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man bent over the soldier, and turned his face upward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, whar are you hit, Johnny?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ericson tried to affect a careless smile, and managed to place his hand on
      his wounded side. The old man unbuttoned his coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I should think so!&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s lost enough of the life
      fluid to paint a barn. Quick, Sally, put down a quilt fer &rsquo;im to lie on in
      front o&rsquo; the fire!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl obeyed as by clock-work, the whiteness of terror and regret in
      her face. She brought an armful of straw and some quilts and hastily
      patted out a crude bed for the soldier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said the old man, &ldquo;you must lie down, Johnny.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ericson sat up erect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to&mdash;to be helpless heer,&rdquo; he stammered. &ldquo;All through
      the war I&rsquo;ve never thought o&rsquo; one single thing except Sally, an&rsquo; now&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl cowered down on the hearth in front of him, and hid her face with
      her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t dream you was wounded,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Ef I&rsquo;d &lsquo;a&rsquo; knowed that, I&rsquo;d
      never &lsquo;a&rsquo; said what I did. Grandpa told the truth jest now, he did. Lie
      down, please do!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He raised his eyes to her with a grateful glance. At this juncture the
      small, remote blast of a bugle fell on their ears, and it struck the
      tenderness from her great moist eyes. She rose and went to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a searchin&rsquo; squad,&rdquo; she cried, her voice vibrating with fear. &ldquo;They
      are at Joe French&rsquo;s house now. They are shore to come heer next. Ef they
      take John away he &rsquo;ll die!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man stared at her rigidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must hide &lsquo;im,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Sally, he&rsquo;s an old friend an&rsquo; a neighbor. We
      must hide &lsquo;im!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The wounded soldier stood up, grasped the edge of the mantel-piece and
      swayed back and forth. There was a sweet comfort in her startled concern
      that rendered him impervious to fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thar ain&rsquo;t no place to hide &lsquo;im,&rdquo; said the girl, with an agonized glance
      through the doorway toward French&rsquo;s house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ericson&rsquo;s knees began to bend, and he sank into his chair again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No use,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;I &lsquo;lowed I mought git to the woods, but I&rsquo;d hobble
      so slow they&rsquo;d be shore to see me. When they git heer I &rsquo;ll tell &rsquo;em you
      wasn&rsquo;t harborin&rsquo; of me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl turned from the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are a-comin&rsquo;,&rdquo; she said. Then her eyes fell on her brother&rsquo;s
      uniform. She started, clutched it, and held it toward her grandfather,
      fired with a sudden hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dress &rsquo;im in it,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I &rsquo;ll go out an&rsquo; meet &rsquo;em an&rsquo; tell &lsquo;em
      nobody ain&rsquo;t heer except you an&rsquo; my wounded brother home on a furlough.
      The permit is in t&rsquo;other room. I &rsquo;ll show &rsquo;em that. They &rsquo;ll never dream
      he ain&rsquo;t brother when they read the furlough an&rsquo; see &rsquo;im in the blue
      uniform.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A sickly smile worked its way through the grimy surface of the soldier&rsquo;s
      face as he raised his hand to signify opposition to her suggestion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t do that, Sally,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Not to save my life, I couldn&rsquo;t.
      Somehow I think the chances o&rsquo; my seein&rsquo; another sunrise is dead ag&rsquo;in&rsquo;
      me, an&rsquo; I don&rsquo;t want to die in any other uniform except the one me an&rsquo; my
      comrades has fought in. I&rsquo;d as soon wear the clothes of a brother o&rsquo; yor
      &rsquo;n as anybody else alive, but I can&rsquo;t put on blue even to escape arrest. I
      jest can&rsquo;t! It would be exactly the same as bein&rsquo; a spy, an&rsquo; the Lord only
      knows how a fightin&rsquo; man hates that sort of a character.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you must,&rdquo; urged the girl, frantically. &ldquo;Oh, you must!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I simply can&rsquo;t. That&rsquo;s all. I&rsquo;d a sight ruther be tuk as a wounded
      soldier unable to stir a single peg than to sneak into another man&rsquo;s
      clothes an&rsquo; deny the side I fit on. Huh, you are a woman! War makes men
      mighty indifferent to anything except duty.&rdquo; A picture of baffled despair,
      the girl peered through the doorway at the approaching men.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You once said you&rsquo;d do anything I asked ef I&rsquo;d consent to marry you.
      John, now will you let grandpa put it on you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A warm scarlet wave had passed over her. She had never looked so
      beautiful. He hesitated for some time, and then shook his head. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t
      put on blue clothes, Sally.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The air was still as death. Above the beat of her strumming pulse she
      could hear the &ldquo;hep! hep!&rdquo; of the soldiers as they marched toward the
      cabin. Ericson staggered to his feet and stood swaying beside her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mought as well go out an&rsquo; meet &lsquo;em,&rdquo; he said, his face awry with pain
      and utter exhaustion. &ldquo;Ef I don&rsquo;t they &rsquo;ll think you are harborin&rsquo; a reb,
      an&rsquo; it mought go ag&rsquo;in&rsquo; you-uns.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he threw out his hands and clutched her shoulders, and sank to the
      floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has fainted, grandpa,&rdquo; said the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quick! Put the uniform on &lsquo;im. I &rsquo;ll try to detain &rsquo;em out thar till you
      are ready.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mought just as well take off his suit an&rsquo; kiver &rsquo;im with quilts,&rdquo;
       suggested the old man. &ldquo;It &rsquo;ll save time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, the uniform!&rdquo; cried the girl. &ldquo;Ef he has that on they won&rsquo;t ask no
      questions&mdash;along with the furlough. You know Jake McLain tried that
      trick on &rsquo;em an&rsquo; failed. Put it on &lsquo;im, for the Lord&rsquo;s sake. Don&rsquo;t stand
      thar idle!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The steady tramp of feet was now audible, and the occasional command of
      the officer in charge. Darting from the back door the girl crossed the
      entry, went into the next room, and emerged with the permit of absence in
      her belt. Picking up a pail near the door, she went to the pig-pen in a
      corner of the zigzag rail fence, and with no eyes for the approaching men,
      slowly poured the food into the animal&rsquo;s trough.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stopping the squad a few yards from her, the captain doffed his cap and
      bowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have come to search your house for possible fugitives from the
      Confederate ranks last night,&rdquo; he said, politely. &ldquo;A good many have been
      found hiding in farmhouses in the vicinity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl set her pail down at her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are Union,&rdquo; she said, simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was told so,&rdquo; the captain answered. &ldquo;Nevertheless, I have orders to
      search your premises. Is there any one within?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody but grandpa an&rsquo; my wounded brother, a Union soldier home on a
      furlough.&rdquo; She took the paper from her belt and unfolded it very
      deliberately. &ldquo;Thar&rsquo;s his permit. I fetched it out to show it so&rsquo;s you
      wouldn&rsquo;t have to wake &rsquo;im up ef you could help it. He couldn&rsquo;t sleep last
      nigh fer the shootin&rsquo;, an&rsquo; the truth is, he is as nigh dead as kin be. I
      wisht you would let &rsquo;im rest.&rdquo; The officer perused the furlough through
      his eyeglasses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; he said, handing it back. &ldquo;But you see I have to obey
      orders.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a pause. The maiden felt the captain&rsquo;s eyes resting on her
      admiringly. She could hear the hobnailed soles of her grandparent&rsquo;s shoes
      grinding on the puncheon floor, and knew that the old man was still
      engaged in dressing or undressing the fugitive.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; she said, in a tone which plainly intimated that the question
      was not positively settled. &ldquo;But it looks like a shame, for brother is
      powerful low, an&rsquo; any noise mought do &rsquo;im lots o&rsquo; harm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I &rsquo;ll leave my men here, and go in myself,&rdquo; compromised the officer. &ldquo;I
      &rsquo;ll walk very lightly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The heart of the girl sank. She could still hear the crunching of her
      grandfather&rsquo;s shoes in the cabin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I &rsquo;ll be much obleeged ef you will be careful,&rdquo; she said. And as he
      started to the cabin she joined him. &ldquo;Please go in here first,&rdquo; pointing
      to the room across the entry from the one containing the two men, &ldquo;an&rsquo; I
      &rsquo;ll run in an&rsquo; see ef brother is fit to be seen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He complied, with a bow, and went into the room indicated. Reappearing in
      a moment, he found her crouching down on the grass, a look of pain on her
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; he asked, with concern.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothin&rsquo;,&rdquo; she winced. &ldquo;I set my foot on that rock an&rsquo; it kinder twisted
      my ankle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He gave her his hand and aided her to rise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please wait jest one minute,&rdquo; she said, putting her foot down
      tentatively. &ldquo;I was in sech a hurry jest now that I almost broke my
      ankle-bone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He bowed assent. His eyes lit with admiration for her physical charms, and
      she limped around to the rear of the cabin and went in. Just as she did so
      the noise of her grandfather&rsquo;s shoes on the floor ceased. The old man,
      thinking she was accompanied by the soldiers, was enacting his part. He
      had flung himself into a chair, and sat nodding as if asleep. On the bed
      of straw lay Ericson, still unconscious, completely clothed in blue
      uniform. The discarded gray suit lay in a bundle in a corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quick, that will never do!&rdquo; she cried, causing the old man to look up
      with a start. Taking a case from a pillow on the bed, she filled it with
      the gray uniform and crushed it into the bottom of the old man&rsquo;s chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Set on it,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;An&rsquo; don&rsquo;t git up, whatever you do.&rdquo; Then she wrung
      her hands despairfully as she surveyed the room. A twitching of Ericson&rsquo;s
      yellow face warned her that he was returning to consciousness, and a new
      terror pierced her heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ef he comes to,&rdquo; she thought, &ldquo;he &rsquo;ll deny being a Union soldier, an&rsquo;
      then they &rsquo;ll take &lsquo;im&mdash;my God, have pity on the pore boy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned from the door and limped smilingly toward the waiting officer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ef brother wakes,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I hope you won&rsquo;t git mad at nothin&rsquo; he
      says. Fer the last two days he has been clean out &rsquo;n his head. Once he
      declared to us that he was actu&rsquo;ly President Jeff Davis. Thar&rsquo;s no tellin&rsquo;
      what idea may strike &rsquo;im next.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I &rsquo;ll try not to wake him,&rdquo; said the captain. &ldquo;I &rsquo;ll merely step inside
      very carefully. I wouldn&rsquo;t do that if&mdash;if my men were not watching.
      You see they&rsquo;d wonder&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come on, then.&rdquo; The rigidity of a crisis held her features. She entered
      first, and pushed the great cumbersome door open before her. The old man
      regarded them with sleepy looks and began to nod again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The officer stood over the form in blue a moment, then peered under the
      bed, and even up the funnel-shaped chimney.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; he whispered to Sally.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ericson opened his eyes and smiled faintly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl comprehended his frame of mind; he had not noticed that his
      clothes had been changed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve run me in a hole,&rdquo; he said to the captain. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m ready to go, but I
      don&rsquo;t want you to think that these folks are a-harborin&rsquo; of me. I come
      heer uninvited. The truth is, that young lady ordered me off, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;d &lsquo;a&rsquo;
      gone, but I keeled over in the door.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He put a hand on either side of him, and with a strenuous effort managed
      to sit up. Then he noticed his change of uniform, and as he plucked
      distastefully at his coat-sleeve, he stared first at the girl and then at
      the captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, who&rsquo;s done this heer?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t no Yankee soldier. I&rsquo;m a
      rebel dyed in the wool.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl laid her hand on the officer&rsquo;s arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come on, please, sir; he&rsquo;s gittin&rsquo; excited. Ef we dispute with &rsquo;im he &lsquo;ll
      git to rantin&rsquo; awful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Without a word the officer followed her from the cabin and down toward
      where his men stood. She walked rapidly, her steps quickened by the rising
      tones of Ericson&rsquo;s voice behind her. She put her handkerchief to her dry
      eyes, and said, plaintively:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hardly know what to do. We&rsquo;ve had no end of trouble. First the news
      come that pa had fell, an&rsquo; then brother come home like he is now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He looks like a very sick man,&rdquo; said the officer, with a bluntness
      peculiar to times of war. &ldquo;Perhaps I ought to ask our surgeon to run over
      and take a look at him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She started, her face fell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Old Doctor Stone, nigh us, is a-lookin&rsquo; after &lsquo;im,&rdquo; was the hasty product
      of her bewildered invention. &ldquo;He &rsquo;ll do all that can be done&mdash;an&rsquo;&mdash;an&rsquo;
      I want to keep brother from thinkin&rsquo; about army folks as much as I can.
      Will you-uns camp nigh us long?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We leave inside of an hour.&rdquo; He raised his cap, saluted his men, gave an
      order, and they whirled and tramped away.
    </p>
    <p>
      She went back into the cabin and sat down by the side of Ericson&rsquo;s pallet.
      There was something in his dumb glance and subdued air that quenched the
      warmth of her recent success. As he looked at her steadily his eyes became
      moist and his powder-stained lips began to quiver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t &rsquo;low you&rsquo;d play sech a dog-mean trick on me, Sally,&rdquo; he
      muttered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d ruther a thousand times &lsquo;a&rsquo; been shot like a soldier than
      to hide in Yankee clothes.&rdquo; Under her warm rush of love and pity for him
      she completely lost the touch of hauteur that had clung to her since his
      return. She took his hand in hers and bent her body down till his fingers
      lay against her cheek. He could feel that she was deeply moved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t stand to see &rsquo;em take you off,&rdquo; she sobbed. &ldquo;Because you are
      all I got on earth to keer fer. It would &lsquo;a&rsquo; killed you, an&rsquo; me, too.&rdquo; Her
      voice took on the gentle cadences of a mother consoling a sick child.
      &ldquo;Grandpa will take off the mean old blue suit an&rsquo; put you up in the big
      bed, and I &rsquo;ll make you some good chicken soup with boiled rice in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He pressed her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you raily want me heer, Sally?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her reply was a moment&rsquo;s hesitation, a convulsive motion of the vocal
      cords, a failure of speech, and a final pressure of her lips on his
      fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beca&rsquo;se ef I &lsquo;lowed you did, Sally, I wouldn&rsquo;t keer much which side beat.
      I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to think about any livin&rsquo; thing but you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you can, then,&rdquo; she said; and she rose quickly. &ldquo;Grandpa, I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo;
      in t&rsquo;other room to fix &rsquo;im some chicken soup. Undress &rsquo;im an&rsquo; put &rsquo;im to
      bed, an&rsquo; then go fetch Doctor Stone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An hour later the old physician arrived and examined the patient.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A flesh wound only,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But he has lost mighty nigh every bit o&rsquo;
      blood in &lsquo;im. Nuss &rsquo;im good, Sally, an&rsquo; he &rsquo;ll be able to make plenty o&rsquo;
      corn and taters fer you the rest o&rsquo; yore life&mdash;that is, if the war
      ever ends.&lsquo;&rsquo; Ericson was convalescing when the news of Lee&rsquo;s surrender
      came floating over the devastated land.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m awfully glad it&rsquo;s all over,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m satisfied. I was shot by a
      Yankee ball an&rsquo; nussed back to life by a Union gal, so I reckon my account
      is even.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      THE HERESY OF ABNER CALIHAN
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">N</span>eil Filmore&rsquo;s
      store was at the crossing of the Big Cabin and Rock Valley roads. Before
      the advent of Sherman into the South it had been a grist-mill, to which
      the hardy mountaineers had regularly brought their grain to be ground, in
      wagons, on horseback, or on their shoulders, according to their
      conditions. But the Northern soldiers had appropriated the miller&rsquo;s little
      stock of toll, had torn down the long wooden sluice which had conveyed the
      water from the race to the mill, had burnt the great wheel and crude
      wooden machinery, and rolled the massive grinding-stones into the deepest
      part of the creek.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the war nobody saw any need for a mill at that point, and Neil
      Filmore had bought the property from its impoverished owner and turned the
      building into a store. It proved to be a fair location, for there was
      considerable travel along the two main roads, and as Filmore was
      postmaster his store became the general meeting-point for everybody living
      within ten miles of the spot. He kept for sale, as he expressed it, &ldquo;a
      little of everything, from shoe-eyes to a sack of guano.&rdquo; Indeed, a sight
      of his rough shelves and unplaned counters, filled with cakes of tallow,
      beeswax and butter, bolts of calico, sheeting and ginghams, and the floor
      and porch heaped with piles of skins, cases of eggs, coops of chickens,
      and cans of lard, was enough to make an orderly housewife shudder with
      horror.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mrs. Filmore had grown accustomed to this state of affairs in the
      front part of the house, for she confined her domestic business, and
      whatever neatness and order were possible, to the room in the rear, where,
      as she often phrased it, she did the &ldquo;eatin&rsquo; an&rsquo; cookin&rsquo;, an&rsquo; never
      interfeer with pap&rsquo;s part except to lend &rsquo;im my cheers when thar is more
      &rsquo;n common waitin&rsquo; fer the mail-carrier.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And her chairs were often in demand, for Filmore was a deacon in Big Cabin
      Church, which stood at the foot of the green-clad mountain a mile down the
      road, and it was at the store that his brother deacons frequently met to
      transact church business.
    </p>
    <p>
      One summer afternoon they held an important meeting. Abner Calihan, a
      member of the church and a good, industrious citizen, was to be tried for
      heresy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has worried me more &rsquo;n anything that has happened sence them two
      Dutchmen over at Cove Spring swapped wives an&rsquo; couldn&rsquo;t be convinced of
      the&rsquo;r error,&rdquo; said long, lean Bill Odell, after he had come in and
      borrowed a candle-box to feed his mule in, and had given the animal eight
      ears of corn from the pockets of his long-tailed coat, and left the mule
      haltered at a hitching-post in front of the store.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ur sence the widder Dill swore she was gwine to sue Hank Dobb&rsquo;s wife fer
      witchcraft,&rdquo; replied Filmore, in a hospitable tone. &ldquo;Take a cheer; it must
      be as hot as a bake-oven out thar in the sun.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bill Odell took off his coat and folded it carefully and laid it across
      the beam of the scales, and unbuttoned his vest and sat down, and
      proceeded to mop his perspiring face with a red bandanna. Toot Bailey came
      in next, a quiet little man of about fifty, with a dark face, straggling
      gray hair, and small, penetrating eyes. His blue jean trousers were
      carelessly stuck into the tops of his clay-stained boots, and he wore a
      sack-coat, a &ldquo;hickory&rdquo; shirt, and a leather belt. Mrs. Filmore put her red
      head and broad, freckled face out of the door of her apartment to see who
      had arrived, and the next moment came out dusting a &ldquo;split-bottomed&rdquo; chair
      with her apron.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How are ye, Toot?&rdquo; was her greeting as she placed the chair for him
      between a jar of fresh honey and a barrel of sorghum molasses. &ldquo;How is the
      sore eyes over yore way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Toler&rsquo;ble,&rdquo; he answered, as he leaned back against the counter and fanned
      himself with his slouch hat. &ldquo;Mine is about through it, but the Tye
      childern is a sight. Pizen-oak hain&rsquo;t a circumstance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did ye use?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Copperas an&rsquo; sweet milk. It is the best thing I&rsquo;ve struck. I don&rsquo;t want
      any o&rsquo; that peppery eye-wash &rsquo;bout my place. It&rsquo;d take the hide off &rsquo;n a
      mule&rsquo;s hind leg.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now yore a-talkin&rsquo;,&rdquo; and Bill Odell went to the water-bucket on the end
      of the counter. He threw his tobacco-quid away, noisily washed out his
      mouth, and took a long drink from the gourd dipper. Then Bart Callaway and
      Amos Sanders, who had arrived half an hour before and had walked down to
      take a look at Filmore&rsquo;s fish-pond, came in together. Both were whittling
      sticks and looking cool and comfortable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are all heer,&rdquo; said Odell, and he added his hat to his coat and the
      pile of weights on the scale-beam, and put his right foot on the rung of
      his chair. &ldquo;I reckon we mought as well proceed.&rdquo; At these words the men
      who had arrived last carefully stowed their hats away under their chairs
      and leaned forward expectantly. Mrs. Filmore glided noiselessly to a
      corner behind the counter, and with folded arms stood ready to hear all
      that was to be said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did anybody inform Ab of the object of this meeting?&rdquo; asked Odell.
    </p>
    <p>
      They all looked at Filmore, and he transferred their glances to his wife.
      She flushed under their scrutiny and awkwardly twisted her fat arms
      together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sister Calihan wuz in here this mornin&rsquo;,&rdquo; she deposed in an uneven tone.
      &ldquo;I &lsquo;lowed somebody amongst &rsquo;em ort to know what you-uns wuz up to, so I up
      an&rsquo; told &lsquo;er.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did she have to say?&rdquo; asked Odell, bending over the scales to spit
      at a crack in the floor, but not removing his eyes from the witness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Law, I hardly know what she didn&rsquo;t say! I never seed a woman take on so.
      Ef the last bit o&rsquo; kin she had on earth wuz suddenly wiped from the face
      o&rsquo; creation, she couldn&rsquo;t &lsquo;a&rsquo; tuk it more to heart. Sally wuz with &lsquo;er,
      an&rsquo; went on wuss &lsquo;an her mammy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What ailed Sally?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Filmore smiled irrepressibly. &ldquo;I reckon you ort to know, Brother
      Odell,&rdquo; she said, under the hand she had raised to hide her smile. &ldquo;Do you
      reckon she hain&rsquo;t heerd o&rsquo; yore declaration that Eph cayn&rsquo;t marry in no
      heretic family while yo &lsquo;re above ground? It wuz goin&rsquo; the round at
      singin&rsquo;-school two weeks ago, and thar hain&rsquo;t been a thing talked sence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hain&rsquo;t got a ioty to retract,&rdquo; replied Odell, looking down into the
      upturned faces for approval. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d as soon see a son o&rsquo; mine in his box.
      Misfortune an&rsquo; plague is boun&rsquo; to foller them that winks at infidelity in
      any disguise ur gyarb.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, shucks! don&rsquo;t fetch the young folks into it, Brother Odell,&rdquo; gently
      protested Bart Callaway. &ldquo;Them two has been a-settin&rsquo; up to each other
      ever sence they wuz knee-high to a duck. They hain&rsquo;t responsible fer the
      doin&rsquo;s o&rsquo; the old folks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hain&rsquo;t got nothin&rsquo; to take back, an&rsquo; Eph knows it,&rdquo; thundered the tall
      deacon, and his face flushed angrily. &ldquo;Ef the membership sees fit to
      excommunicate Ab Calihan, none o&rsquo; his stock &rsquo;ll ever come into my family.
      But this is dilly-dallyin&rsquo; over nothin&rsquo;. You fellers &rsquo;ll set thar cocked
      up, an&rsquo; chaw an&rsquo; spit, an&rsquo; look knowin&rsquo;, an&rsquo; let the day pass &lsquo;thout doin&rsquo;
      a single thing. Ab Calihan is either fitten or unfitten, one ur t&rsquo;other.
      Brother Filmore, you&rsquo;ve seed &rsquo;im the most, now what&rsquo;s he let fall that&rsquo;s
      undoctrinal?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Filmore got up and laid his clay pipe on the counter and kicked back his
      chair with his foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fust indications I noticed,&rdquo; he began, in a raised voice, as if he
      were speaking to some one outside, &ldquo;wuz the day Liz Wambush died. Bud
      Thorn come in while I wuz weighing up a side o&rsquo; bacon fur Ab, an&rsquo; &lsquo;lowed
      that Liz couldn&rsquo;t live through the night. I axed &rsquo;im ef she had made her
      peace, and he &lsquo;lowed she had, entirely, that she wuz jest a-lyin&rsquo; thar
      shoutin&rsquo; Glory ever&rsquo; breath she drawed, an&rsquo; that they all wuz glad to see
      her reconciled, fer you know she wuz a hard case speritually. Well, it wuz
      right back thar at the fireplace while Ab wuz warmin&rsquo; hisse&rsquo;f to start
      home that he &lsquo;lowed that he hadn&rsquo;t a word to say agin Liz&rsquo;s marvelous
      faith, nur her sudden speritual spurt, but that in his opinion the
      doctrine o&rsquo; salvation through faith without actual deeds of the flesh to
      give it backbone wuz all shucks, an&rsquo; a dangerous doctrine to teach to a
      risin&rsquo; gineration. Them wuz his words as well as I can remember, an&rsquo; he
      cited a good many cases to demonstrate that the members o&rsquo; Big Cabin
      wuzn&rsquo;t any more ready to help a needy neighbor than a equal number outside
      the church. He wuz mad kase last summer when his wheat wuz spilin&rsquo;
      everybody that come to he&rsquo;p wuz uv some other denomination, an&rsquo; the whole
      lot o&rsquo; Big Cabin folks made some excuse ur other. He &lsquo;lowed that you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Filmore hesitated, and the tall man opposite him changed countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Neil, hain&rsquo;t you got a bit o&rsquo; sense?&rdquo; put in Mrs. Filmore, sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did he say ag&rsquo;in&rsquo; me&mdash;the scamp?&rdquo; asked Odell, firing up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Filmore turned his back to his scowling wife, and took an egg from a
      basket on the counter and looked at it closely, as he rolled it over and
      over in his fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lots that he ortn&rsquo;t to, I reckon,&rdquo; he said, evasively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what wuz <i>some</i> of it? I hain&rsquo;t a-keerin&rsquo; what he says about
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He &lsquo;lowed, fer one thing, that yore strict adheerance to doctrine had
      hardened you some, wharas religious conviction, ef thar wuz any divine
      intention in it, ort, in reason, to have a contrary effect. He &lsquo;lowed you
      wuz money-lovin&rsquo; an&rsquo; uncharitable an&rsquo; unfergivin&rsquo; an&rsquo;, a heap o&rsquo; times,
      un-Christian in yore persecution o&rsquo; the weak an&rsquo; helpless&mdash;them that
      has no food an&rsquo; raiment&mdash;when yore crib an&rsquo; smokehouse is always
      full. Ab is a powerful talker, an&rsquo;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the devil in &rsquo;im a-talkin&rsquo;,&rdquo; interrupted Odell, angrily, &ldquo;an&rsquo; it&rsquo;s
      plain enough that he ort to be churched. Brother Sanders, you intimated
      that you&rsquo;d have a word to say; let us have it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sanders, a heavy-set man, bald-headed and red-bearded, rose. He took a
      prodigious quid of tobacco from his mouth and dropped it on the floor at
      the side of his chair. His remarks were crisp and to the point.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My opinion is that Ab Calihan hain&rsquo;t a bit more right in our church than
      Bob Inglesel. He&rsquo;s got plumb crooked.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have you heerd &rsquo;im say? That&rsquo;s what we want to git at,&rdquo; said Odell,
      his leathery face brightening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More &rsquo;n I keered to listen at. He has been readin&rsquo; stuff he ortn&rsquo;t to. He
      give up takin&rsquo; the <i>Advocate</i>, an&rsquo; wouldn&rsquo;t go in Mary Bank&rsquo;s club
      when they&rsquo;ve been takin&rsquo; it in his family fer the last five year, an&rsquo; has
      been subscribin&rsquo; fer the <i>True Light</i> sence Christmas. The last time
      I met &rsquo;im at Big Cabin, I think it wuz the second Sunday, he couldn&rsquo;t talk
      o&rsquo; nothin&rsquo; else but what this great man an&rsquo; t&rsquo;other had writ somewhar up
      in Yankeedom, an&rsquo; that ef we all keep along in our little rut we &rsquo;ll soon
      be the laughin&rsquo;-stock of all the rest of the enlightened world. Ab is a
      slippery sort of a feller, an&rsquo; it&rsquo;s mighty hard to ketch &lsquo;im, but I nailed
      &rsquo;im on one vital p&rsquo;int.&rdquo; Sanders paused for a moment, stroked his beard,
      and then continued: &ldquo;He got excited sorter, an&rsquo; &lsquo;lowed that he had come to
      the conclusion that hell warn&rsquo;t no literal, burnin&rsquo; one nohow, that he had
      too high a regyard fer the Almighty to believe that He would amuse Hisse&rsquo;f
      roastin&rsquo; an&rsquo; feedin&rsquo; melted lead to His creatures jest to see &rsquo;em squirm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He disputes the Bible, then,&rdquo; said Odell, conclusively, looking first
      into one face and then another. &ldquo;He sets his puny self up ag&rsquo;in&rsquo; the
      Almighty. The Book that has softened the pillers o&rsquo; thousands; the Word
      that has been the consolation o&rsquo; millions an&rsquo; quintillions o&rsquo; mortals of
      sense an&rsquo; judgment in all ages an&rsquo; countries is a pack o&rsquo; lies from kiver
      to kiver. I don&rsquo;t see a bit o&rsquo; use goin&rsquo; furder with this investigation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Just then Mrs. Filmore stepped out from her corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hain&rsquo;t been axed to put in,&rdquo; she said, warmly; &ldquo;but ef I wuz you-uns
      I&rsquo;d go slow with Abner Calihan. He&rsquo;s nobody&rsquo;s fool. He&rsquo;s too good a
      citizen to be hauled an&rsquo; drug about like a dog with a rope round his neck.
      He fit on the right side in the war, an&rsquo; to my certain knowledge has done
      more to &lsquo;ds keepin&rsquo; peace an&rsquo; harmony in this community than any other
      three men in it. He has set up with the sick an&rsquo; toted medicine to &lsquo;em,
      an&rsquo; fed the pore an&rsquo; housed the homeless. Here only last week he got
      hisse&rsquo;f stung all over the face an&rsquo; neck helpin&rsquo; that lazy Joe Sebastian
      hive his bees, an&rsquo; Joe an&rsquo; his triflin&rsquo; gang didn&rsquo;t git a scratch. You may
      see the day you &rsquo;ll regret it ef you run dry shod over that man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We simply intend to do our duty, Sister Filmore,&rdquo; said Odell, slightly
      taken aback; &ldquo;but you kin see that church rules must be obeyed. I move we
      go up thar in a body an&rsquo; lay the case squar before &lsquo;im. Ef he is willin&rsquo;
      to take back his wild assertions an&rsquo; go&rsquo;long quietly without tryin&rsquo; to
      play smash with the religious order of the whole community, he may stay in
      on probation. What do you-uns say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all we kin do now,&rdquo; said Sanders; and they all rose and reached for
      their hats.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;d better stay an&rsquo; look atter the store,&rdquo; Filmore called back to his
      wife from the outside; &ldquo;somebody mought happen along.&rdquo; With a reluctant
      nod of her head she acquiesced, and came out on the little porch and
      looked after them as they trudged along the hot road toward Abner
      Calihan&rsquo;s farm. When they were out of sight she turned back into the
      store. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she muttered, &ldquo;Abner Calihan <i>may</i> put up with that
      triflin&rsquo; layout a-interfeerin&rsquo; with &rsquo;im when he is busy a-savin&rsquo; his hay,
      but ef he don&rsquo;t set his dogs on &rsquo;em he is a better Christian &lsquo;an I think
      he is&rsquo; an&rsquo; he&rsquo;s a good un. They are a purty-lookin&rsquo; set to be a-dictatin&rsquo;
      to a man like him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A little wagon-way, which was not used enough to kill the stubbly grass
      that grew on it, ran from the main road out to Calihan&rsquo;s house. The woods
      through which the little road had been cut were so thick and the foliage
      so dense that the overlapping branches often hid the sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      Calihan&rsquo;s house was a four-roomed log building which had been
      weather-boarded on the outside with upright unpainted planks. On the right
      side of the house was an orchard, and beneath some apple-trees near the
      door stood an old-fashioned cider-press, a pile of acid-stained rocks
      which had been used as weights in the press, and numerous tubs, barrels,
      jugs, and jars, and piles of sour-smelling refuse, over which buzzed a
      dense swarm of honey-bees, wasps, and yellow-jackets. On the other side of
      the house, in a chip-strewn yard, stood cords upon cords of wood, and
      several piles of rich pine-knots and charred pine-logs, which the
      industrious farmer had on rainy days hauled down from the mountains for
      kindling-wood. Behind the house was a great log barn and a stable-yard,
      and beyond them lay the cornfields and the lush green meadow, where a
      sinuous line of willows and slender cane-brakes marked the course of a
      little creek.
    </p>
    <p>
      The approach of the five visitors was announced to Mrs. Calihan and her
      daughter by a yelping rush toward the gate of half a dozen dogs which had
      been napping and snapping at flies on the porch. Mrs. Calihan ran out into
      the yard and vociferously called the dogs off, and with awed hospitality
      invited the men into the little sitting-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those of them who cared to inspect their surroundings saw a rag carpet,
      walls of bare, hewn logs, the cracks of which had been filled with yellow
      mud, a little table in the center of the room, and a cottage organ against
      the wall near the small window. On the mantel stood a new clock and a
      glass lamp, the globe of which held a piece of red flannel and some oil.
      The flannel was to give the lamp color. Indeed, lamps with flannel in them
      were very much in vogue in that part of the country.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me an&rsquo; Sally wuz sorter expectin&rsquo; ye,&rdquo; said Mrs. Calihan, as she gave
      them seats and went around and took their hats from their knees and laid
      them on a bed in the next room. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what to make of Mr.
      Calihan,&rdquo; she continued, plaintively. &ldquo;He never wuz this away before. When
      we wuz married he could offer up the best prayer of any young man in the
      settlement. The Mount Zion meetin&rsquo;-house couldn&rsquo;t hold protracted meetin&rsquo;
      without &lsquo;im. He fed more preachers an&rsquo; the&rsquo;r hosses than anybody else, an&rsquo;
      some &lsquo;lowed that he wuz jest too natcherly good to pass away like common
      folks, an&rsquo; that when his time come he&rsquo;d jest disappear body an&rsquo; all.&rdquo; She
      was now wiping her eyes on her apron, and her voice had the suggestion of
      withheld emotions. &ldquo;I never calculated on him bringin&rsquo; sech disgrace as
      this on his family.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whar is he now?&rdquo; asked Odell, preliminarily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Down thar stackin&rsquo; hay. Sally begun on &rsquo;im ag&rsquo;in at dinner about yore
      orders to Eph, an&rsquo; he went away &lsquo;thout finishin&rsquo; his dinner. She&rsquo;s been
      a-cryin&rsquo; an&rsquo; a-poutin&rsquo; an&rsquo; takin&rsquo; on fer a week, an&rsquo; won&rsquo;t tech a bite to
      eat. I never seed a gal so bound up in anybody as she is in Eph. It has
      mighty nigh driv her pa distracted, kase he likes Eph, an&rsquo; Sally&rsquo;s his
      pet.&rdquo; Mrs. Calihan turned her head toward the adjoining room: &ldquo;Sally, oh,
      Sally! are ye listenin&rsquo;? Come heer a minute!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was silence for a moment, then a sound of heavy shoes on the floor
      of the next room, and a tall rather good-looking girl entered. Her eyes
      and cheeks were red, and she hung her head awkwardly, and did not look at
      any one but her mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you call me, ma?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, honey; run an&rsquo; tell yore pa they are all heer,&mdash;the last one of
      &lsquo;em, an&rsquo; fer him to hurry right on to the house an&rsquo; not keep &lsquo;em
      a-waitin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes-sum!&rdquo; And without any covering for her head the visitors saw her dart
      across the back yard toward the meadow.
    </p>
    <p>
      With his pitchfork on his shoulder, a few minutes later Abner Calihan came
      up to the back door of his house. He wore no coat, and but one frayed
      suspender supported his patched and baggy trousers. His broad, hairy
      breast showed through the opening in his shirt. His tanned cheeks and neck
      were corrugated, his hair and beard long and reddish brown. His brow was
      high and broad, and a pair of blue eyes shone serenely beneath his shaggy
      brows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good evenin&rsquo;,&rdquo; he said, leaning his pitchfork against the door-jamb
      outside and entering. Without removing his hat he went around and gave a
      damp hand to each visitor. &ldquo;It is hard work savin&rsquo; hay sech weather as
      this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No one replied to this remark, though they all nodded and looked as if
      they wanted to give utterance to something struggling within them. Calihan
      swung a chair over near the door, and sat down and leaned back against the
      wall, and looked out at the chickens in the yard and the gorgeous peacock
      strutting about in the sun. No one seemed quite ready to speak, so, to
      cover his embarrassment, he looked farther over in the yard to his
      potato-bank and pig-pens, and then up into the clear sky for indications
      of rain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon you know our business, Brother Calihan,&rdquo; began Odell, in a voice
      that broke the silence harshly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon I could make a purty good guess,&rdquo; and Calihan spit over his left
      shoulder into the yard. &ldquo;I hain&rsquo;t heerd nothin&rsquo; else fer a week. From all
      the talk, a body&rsquo;d &rsquo;low I&rsquo;d stole somebody&rsquo;s hawgs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We jest <i>had</i> to take action,&rdquo; affirmed the self-constituted speaker
      for the others. &ldquo;The opinions you have expressed,&rdquo; and Odell at once began
      to warm up to his task, &ldquo;are so undoctrinal an&rsquo; so p&rsquo;int blank ag&rsquo;in&rsquo; the
      articles of faith that, believin&rsquo; as you seem to believe, you are plumb
      out o&rsquo; j&rsquo;int with Big Cabin Church, an&rsquo; a resky man in any God-feerin&rsquo;
      community. God Almighty&rdquo;&mdash;and those who saw Odell&rsquo;s twitching upper
      lip and indignantly flashing eye knew that the noted &ldquo;exhorter&rdquo; was about
      to become mercilessly personal and vindictive&mdash;&ldquo;God Almighty is the
      present ruler of the universe, but sence you have set up to run ag&rsquo;in&rsquo; Him
      it looks like you&rsquo;d need a wider scope of territory to transact business
      in than jest heer in this settlement.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The blood had left Calihan&rsquo;s face. His eyes swept from one stern,
      unrelenting countenance to another till they rested on his wife and
      daughter, who sat side by side, their faces in their aprons, their
      shoulders quivering with soundless sobs. They had forsaken him. He was an
      alien in his own house, a criminal convicted beneath his own roof. His
      rugged breast rose and fell tumultuously as he strove to command his
      voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hain&rsquo;t meant no harm&mdash;not a speck,&rdquo; he faltered, as he wiped the
      perspiration from his quivering chin. &ldquo;I hain&rsquo;t no hand to stir up strife
      in a community. I&rsquo;ve tried to be law-abidin&rsquo; an&rsquo; honest, but it don&rsquo;t seem
      like a man kin he&rsquo;p thinkin&rsquo;. He&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he kin keep his thinkin&rsquo; to hisse&rsquo;f,&rdquo; interrupted Odell, sharply; and
      a pause came after his words.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a jerky fashion Calihan spit over his shoulder again. He looked at his
      wife and daughter for an instant, and nodded several times as if
      acknowledging the force of Odell&rsquo;s words. Bart Callaway took out his
      tobacco-quid and nervously shuffled it about in his palm as if he had half
      made up his mind that Odell ought not to do all the talking, but he
      remained mute, for Mrs. Calihan had suddenly looked up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I told him,&rdquo; she whimpered, bestowing a tearful glance on her
      husband. &ldquo;He mought &lsquo;a&rsquo; kep&rsquo; his idees to hisse&rsquo;f ef he had to have &lsquo;em,
      and not &lsquo;a&rsquo; fetched calumny an&rsquo; disgrace down on me an&rsquo; Sally. When he
      used to set thar atter supper an&rsquo; pore over the <i>True Light</i> when
      ever&rsquo;body else wuz in bed, I knowed it&rsquo;d bring trouble, kase some o&rsquo; the
      doctrine wuz scand&rsquo;lous. The next thing I knowed he had lost intrust in
      prayer-meetin&rsquo;, an&rsquo; &lsquo;lowed that Brother Washburn&rsquo;s sermons wuz the same
      thing over an&rsquo; over, an&rsquo; that they mighty nigh put him to sleep. An&rsquo; then
      he give up axin&rsquo; the blessin&rsquo; at the table&mdash;somethin&rsquo; that has been
      done in my fam&rsquo;ly as fur back as the oldest one kin remember. An&rsquo; he
      talked his views, too, fer it got out, an&rsquo; me nur Sally narry one never
      cheeped it, fer we wuz ashamed. An&rsquo; then ever&rsquo; respectable woman in Big
      Cabin meetin&rsquo;-house begun to sluff away from us as ef they wuz afeerd o&rsquo;
      takin&rsquo; some dreadful disease. It wuz hard enough on Sally at the start,
      but when Eph up an&rsquo; tol&rsquo; her that you had give him a good tongue-lashin&rsquo;,
      an&rsquo; had refused to deed him the land you promised him ef he went any
      further with her, it mighty nigh prostrated her. She hain&rsquo;t done one thing
      lately but look out at the road an&rsquo; pine an&rsquo; worry. The blame is all on
      her father. My folks has all been good church members as fur back as kin
      be traced, an&rsquo; narry one wuz ever turned out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Calihan broke down and wept. Calihan was deeply touched; he could not
      bear to see a woman cry. He cleared his throat and tried to look
      unconcerned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What step do you-uns feel called on to take next to&mdash;to what you are
      a-doin&rsquo; of now?&rdquo; he stammered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We &lsquo;lowed,&rdquo; replied Odell, &ldquo;ef we couldn&rsquo;t come to some sort o&rsquo;
      understandin&rsquo; with you now, we&rsquo;d fetch up the case before preachin&rsquo;
      to-morrow an&rsquo; let the membership vote on it. The verdict would go ag&rsquo;in&rsquo;
      you, Ab, fer thar hain&rsquo;t a soul in sympathy with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sobbing of the two women broke out in renewed volume at the mention of
      this dreadful ultimatum, which, despite their familiarity with the rigor
      of Big Cabin Church discipline, they had up to this moment regarded as a
      vague contingent rather than a tangible certainty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Calihan&rsquo;s face grew paler. Whatever struggle might have been going on in
      his mind was over. He was conquered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am ag&rsquo;in&rsquo; bringin&rsquo; reproach on my wife an&rsquo; child,&rdquo; he conceded, a lump
      in his throat and a tear in his eye. &ldquo;You all know best. I reckon I have
      been too forward an&rsquo; too eager to heer myself talk.&rdquo; He got up and looked
      out toward the towering cliffy mountains and into the blue indefiniteness
      above them, and without looking at the others he finished awkwardly: &ldquo;Ef
      it&rsquo;s jest the same to you-uns you may let the charge drap, an&rsquo;&mdash;an&rsquo;
      in future I &rsquo;ll give no cause fer complaint.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the talk,&rdquo; said Odell, warmly, and he got up and gave his hand to
      Calihan. The others followed his example.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I &rsquo;ll make a little speech before preachin&rsquo; in the mornin&rsquo;,&rdquo; confided
      Odell to Calihan after congratulations were over. &ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t be thar
      unless you want to. I &rsquo;ll fix you up all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Calihan smiled faintly and looked shamefacedly toward the meadow, and
      reached outside and took hold of the handle of his pitchfork.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to try to git through that haystack &lsquo;fore dark,&rdquo; he said,
      awkwardly. &ldquo;Ef you-uns will be so kind as to excuse me now I &rsquo;ll run down
      and finish up. I&rsquo;d sorter set myself a task to do, an&rsquo; I don&rsquo;t like to
      fall short o&rsquo; my mark.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Down in the meadow Calihan worked like a tireless machine, not pausing for
      a moment to rest his tense muscles. He was trying to make up for the time
      he had lost with his guests. Higher and smaller grew the great haystack as
      it slowly tapered toward its apex. The red sun sank behind the mountain
      and began to draw in its long streamers of light. The gray of dusk, as if
      fleeing from its darker self, the monster night, crept up from the east,
      and with a thousand arms extended moved on after the receding light.
    </p>
    <p>
      Calihan worked on till the crickets began to shrill and the frogs in the
      marshes to croak, and the hay beneath his feet felt damp with dew. The
      stack was finished. He leaned on his fork and inspected his work
      mechanically. It was a perfect cone. Every outside straw and blade of
      grass lay smoothly downward, like the hair on a well-groomed horse. Then
      with his fork on his shoulder he trudged slowly up the narrow field-road
      toward the house. He was vaguely grateful for the darkness; a strange,
      new, childish embarrassment was on him. For the first time in life he was
      averse to meeting his wife and child.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been spanked an&rsquo; told to behave ur it &rsquo;ud go wuss with me,&rdquo; he
      muttered. &ldquo;I never wuz talked to that away before by nobody, but I jest
      had to take it. Sally an&rsquo; her mother never would &lsquo;a&rsquo; heerd the last of it
      ef I had let out jest once. No man, I reckon, has a moral right to act so
      as to make his family miserable. I crawfished, I know, an&rsquo; on short
      notice; but law me! I wouldn&rsquo;t have Bill Odell&rsquo;s heart in me fer ever&rsquo;
      acre o&rsquo; bottom-lan&rsquo; in this valley. I wouldn&rsquo;t &lsquo;a&rsquo; talked to a houn&rsquo; dog
      as he did to me right before Sally an&rsquo; her mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was very weary when he leaned his fork against the house and turned to
      wash his face and hands in the tin basin on the bench at the side of the
      steps. Mrs. Calihan came to the door, her face beaming.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wuz afeerd you never would come,&rdquo; she said, in a sweet, winning tone.
      &ldquo;I got yore beans warmed over an&rsquo; some o&rsquo; yore brag yam taters cooked.
      Come on in &lsquo;fore the coffee an&rsquo; biscuits git cold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I &rsquo;ll be thar in a minute,&rdquo; he said; and he rolled up his sleeves and
      plunged his hot hands and face into the cold spring-water.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a clean towel, pa; somebody has broke the roller.&rdquo; It was Sally.
      She had put on her best white muslin gown and braided her rich, heavy hair
      into two long plaits which hung down her back. There was no trace of the
      former redness about her eyes, and her face was bright and full of
      happiness. He wiped his hands and face on the towel she held, and took a
      piece of a comb from his vest pocket and hurriedly raked his coarse hair
      backward. He looked at her tenderly and smiled in an abashed sort of way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anybody comin&rsquo; to-night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eph Odell, I &rsquo;ll bet my hat!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl nodded, and blushed and hung her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Odell &lsquo;lowed I mought look fer him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Abner Calihan laughed slowly and put his arm around his daughter, and
      together they went toward the steps of the kitchen door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You seed yore old daddy whipped clean out to-day,&rdquo; he said, tentatively.
      &ldquo;I reckon yo &lsquo;re ashamed to see him sech a coward an&rsquo; have him sneak away
      like a dog with his tail tucked &rsquo;tween his legs. Bill Odell is a power in
      this community.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She laughed with him, but she did not understand his banter, and preceded
      him into the kitchen. It was lighted by a large tallow-dip in the center
      of the table. There was much on the white cloth to tempt a hungry
      laborer&rsquo;s appetite&mdash;a great dish of greasy string-beans, with pieces
      of bacon, a plate of smoking biscuits, and a platter of fried ham in brown
      gravy. But he was not hungry. Slowly and clumsily he drew up his chair and
      sat down opposite his wife and daughter. He slid a quivering thumb under
      the edge of his inverted plate and turned it half over, but noticing that
      they had their hands in their laps and had reverently bowed their heads,
      he cautiously replaced it. In a flash he comprehended what was expected of
      him. The color surged into his homely face. He played with his knife for a
      moment, and then stared at them stubbornly, almost defiantly. They did not
      look up, but remained motionless and patiently expectant. The dread of the
      protracted silence, for which he was becoming more and more responsible,
      conquered him. He lowered his head and spoke in a low, halting tone:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Lord, Father of us all, have mercy on our sins, and make us thankful
      fer these, Thy many blessings. Amen.&rdquo;

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">S</span>everal customers
      were gathered in Mark Wyndham&rsquo;s store at the cross-roads. They were rough
      farmers, wearing jean clothing, slouch hats, and coarse, dusty brogans.
    </p>
    <p>
      A stranger, a man of quite a different type, came in and sat down near the
      side door. At first the crowd gazed at him curiously, but after a while he
      seemed to pass out of their minds. When he had waited on all his
      customers, Mark approached the stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By hookey!&rdquo; he exclaimed, pausing in astonishment, and then extending his
      hand, &ldquo;as the Lord is my Maker, it&rsquo;s Luke King! Who&rsquo;d ever expect to see
      you turn up?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; Luke King it will have to be, since you, like all the rest, won&rsquo;t
      call me by my right name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mark laughed apologetically. &ldquo;Oh, I forgot you never could bear to be
      called by yore step-daddy&rsquo;s name; but you wuz raised up with the King
      layout, an&rsquo; Laramore is not a easy word to handle. Well, I reckon you are
      follerin&rsquo; what you started&mdash;writin&rsquo; books?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I &lsquo;lowed you&rsquo;d stick to it. I never seed a feller study harder an&rsquo; want
      to do a thing as bad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lucian Laramore smiled. &ldquo;Did any one here ever find out that I had adopted
      that profession?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a soul, Luke. I never let on to anybody that I knowed it, an&rsquo; the
      folks round heer don&rsquo;t read much. They mought &lsquo;a&rsquo; suspected some &lsquo;n&rsquo; ef
      Luke King had been signed to yore books and stories, but nobody ever
      called you by yore right name. What on earth ever made you come home?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was my mother that brought me here, Mark&mdash;not the others,&rdquo; said
      Laramore. &ldquo;If a man is a man, no sort of fame or prosperity can make him
      forget his mother. I planned to come back several times, but something
      always prevented it. However, when you wrote me that the last time you saw
      her she was not looking well, I decided to come at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mark was critically surveying his old friend from head to foot while he
      was speaking. Laramore smiled, and added, &ldquo;You are wondering why I am so
      plainly dressed, Mark; you needn&rsquo;t deny it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mark flushed when he replied: &ldquo;Well, I did &rsquo;low you fellers &rsquo;ud put on
      more style &rsquo;n we-uns down here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an old suit I have worn out hunting in Canada. I put it on because I
      intended to do a good deal of walking; and then, to tell the truth, I
      thought it would look better for me to go back very simply dressed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a fact, now I think of it; well, I wish you luck over thar. Goin&rsquo;
      ter foot it over?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; it is only three miles, and I have plenty of time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the walk was longer than Laramore thought it would be, and he was hot,
      damp with perspiration, and covered with dust when he reached the
      four-roomed cabin among the stunted pines and wild cedars.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Sam King sat out in front of the door. He wore no shoes nor coat, and
      his hickory shirt and jean trousers had been patched many times. His hair
      was long, sun-burned, and tangled, and the corrugated skin of his cheek
      and neck was covered with straggling hairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the stranger came in view from behind the pine-pole pig-pen, the old
      man uttered a grunt of surprise that brought to the door two young women
      in homespun dresses, and a tall, lank young man in his shirt-sleeves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you don&rsquo;t remember me,&rdquo; said Laramore, and he put his satchel
      on a wash-bench by a tub and a piggin of lye soap.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I reckon nobody in this shack is gwine to &rsquo;spute with you,&rdquo; rumbled
      the old man, as with his chin in his hand, he lazily looked at the face
      before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I might not have known you either if I had not been told that you lived
      here. I am the fellow you used to call Luke King.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Jacks!&rdquo; After that ejaculation the old man and the others stared
      speechlessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s who I am,&rdquo; continued Laramore. &ldquo;How do you do, Jake?&rdquo; (to the
      lank young man in the door). &ldquo;We might as well shake hands. You girls have
      grown into women since I left. I&rsquo;ve stayed away a long time, and been
      nearly all over the world, but I&rsquo;ve always wanted to get back. Where is
      mother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Neither of the girls could summon up the courage to answer, and they
      seemed under stress of great embarrassment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is porely,&rdquo; said the old man, inhospitably keeping his seat. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s
      had a hurtin&rsquo; in &rsquo;er side from usin&rsquo; that thar battlin&rsquo;-stick too much on
      dirty clothes, an&rsquo; her cold has settled on &rsquo;er chest. Mary, go tell yore
      maw Luke&rsquo;s got back. Huh, we all &lsquo;lowed you wuz dead &lsquo;cept her. She al&rsquo;ays
      contended you wuz alive som &lsquo;ers. How&rsquo;s times been a-servin&rsquo; uv you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pretty well.&rdquo; Laramore put his satchel on the ground and sat down wearily
      on the bench by the tub.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Things is awful slow heer. Whar have you been hangin&rsquo; out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nowhere in particular&mdash;that is, I have lived in a good many places.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huh! &rsquo;bout as I expected; an&rsquo; I reckon you hain&rsquo;t got nothin&rsquo; at all ter
      show fer it &lsquo;cept what you&rsquo;ve got on yore back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s about all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What you been a-follerin&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Laramore colored sensitively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Writing for papers and magazines.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I &lsquo;lowed you mought go at some &lsquo;n&rsquo; o&rsquo; that sort; you used to try mighty
      hard to write a good hand; you never would work. Married?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hain&rsquo;t able to support a woman I reckon. Well, you showed a great lot of
      good sense thar; a feller can sorter manage to shift fer hisse&rsquo;f ef he
      hain&rsquo;t hampered by a pack o&rsquo; children an&rsquo; er sick woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that juncture Mary returned. She flushed as she caught Laramore&rsquo;s
      expectant glance. She spoke to her father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maw said tell &rsquo;im ter come in thar.&rdquo; Laramore went into the front room
      and turned into a small apartment adjoining. It was windowless and dark,
      the only light filtering through the front room. On a low, narrow bed
      beneath a ladder leading to a trap-door above, lay a woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here I am, Luke,&rdquo; she cried out, excitedly. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t stumble over that pan
      o&rsquo; water! I&rsquo;ve been taking a mustard footbath to try an&rsquo; git my blood
      warm. La, me! How you did take me by surprise! I&rsquo;ve prayed for little else
      in many er yeer, an&rsquo; I was jest about ter give it up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His foot touched a three-legged stool, and he drew it to the head of her
      bed and sat down. He took one of her hard, thin hands and bent over her.
      Should he kiss her? She had not taught him to do so when he was a child,
      and he had never kissed her in his life, but he had seen the world and
      grown wiser. He turned her face toward him and pressed his lips to hers.
      She was much surprised, and drew herself from him and wiped her mouth with
      a corner of the sheet, but he knew she was pleased.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Luke, what on earth do you mean? Have you gone plumb crazy?&rdquo; she
      said, quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wanted to kiss you, that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; he said, awkwardly. They were both
      silent for a moment, then she spoke, tremblingly: &ldquo;You al&rsquo;ays was womanish
      an&rsquo; tender-like; it don&rsquo;t do a body any harm; none o&rsquo; the rest ain&rsquo;t that
      way. But, my stars! I cayn&rsquo;t tell a bit how you look in this pitch dark.
      Mary! oh, Mary!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Laramore released his mother&rsquo;s hand, and sat up erect as the girl came to
      the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What you want, maw?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cayn&rsquo;t see my hand&rsquo;fore me; I wish you&rsquo;d fetch a light heer. You &lsquo;ll
      find a piece o&rsquo; candle in the clock; I hid it there to keep Jake from
      usin&rsquo; it in his lantern.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl lit the bit of tallow-dip, and fastened it in the neck of a
      bottle. She brought it in, stood it on a box filled with cotton-seed and
      ears of corn, and shambled out. Laramore&rsquo;s heart sank as he looked around
      him. The room was nothing but a lean-to shed walled with upright slabs and
      floored with puncheons. The bedstead was a crude wooden frame supported by
      perpendicular saplings fastened to floor and rafters. The cracks in the
      wall were filled with mud, rags, and newspapers. Bunches of dried herbs
      hung above his head, and piles of old clothing and agricultural implements
      lay about indiscriminately. Disturbed by the light, a hen flew from her
      nest behind a dismantled loom, and with a loud cackling went out at the
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old woman gazed at him eagerly. &ldquo;You hain&rsquo;t altered so overly much,&rdquo;
       she observed, &ldquo;&lsquo;cept yore skin looks mighty white, and yore hands feel
      soft.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then she lowered her voice into a whisper, and glanced furtively toward
      the door. &ldquo;You favor yore father&mdash;I don&rsquo;t mean Sam, but Mr. Laramore.
      Yore as like as two peas. He helt his head that away, an&rsquo; had yore way o&rsquo;
      bein&rsquo; gentle with womenfolks. You&rsquo;ve got his high temper, too. La, me!
      that last night you was at home, an&rsquo; Sam cussed you, an&rsquo; kicked yore books
      into the fire, I didn&rsquo;t sleep a wink. I thought you&rsquo;d gone off to borrow a
      gun. It was almost a relief to know you&rsquo;d left, kase I seed you an&rsquo; Sam
      couldn&rsquo;t git along. Yore father was a different sort of a man, Luke; he
      loved books an&rsquo; study, like you. He had good blood in &lsquo;im; his father was
      a teacher an&rsquo; a circuit-rider. I don&rsquo;t know why I married Sam, &rsquo;less it
      was &rsquo;kase I was young an&rsquo; helpless, an&rsquo; you was a baby.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a low whimper in her voice, and the lines about her mouth
      tightened. Lara-more&rsquo;s breast heaved, and he suddenly put out his hand and
      began to stroke her thin, gray hair. A strange, restful feeling stole over
      him. The spell was on her, too; she closed her eyes, and a blissful smile
      lighted her wan face. Then her lips began to quiver, and she turned her
      face from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m er simpleton,&rdquo; she sobbed, &ldquo;but I cayn&rsquo;t he&rsquo;p it. Nobody hain&rsquo;t
      petted me nur tuk on over me a bit sence yore paw died. I never treated
      you right, nuther, Luke; I ort never to &lsquo;a&rsquo; let Sam run over you like he
      did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind that,&rdquo; Laramore replied, tenderly; &ldquo;but you must not lie here
      in this dingy hole; you need medicine and good food.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m gwine ter git up,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sick; I jest laid down ter
      rest. I must git the house straight. Mary and Jane hain&rsquo;t no hands at
      housework &lsquo;thout I stand over &lsquo;em, and Jake an&rsquo; his paw is continually
      a-fussin&rsquo;. I feel stronger already; ef you &rsquo;ll go in t&rsquo;other room I &lsquo;ll
      rise. They &rsquo;ll never fix you nothin&rsquo; ter eat, nur nowhar to sleep. I
      reckon you &rsquo;ll have to lie with Jake, like you useter, tel I can fix
      better. Things is in a awful mess sence I got porely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went into the front room. The old man had brought his satchel in. He
      had opened it in a chair, and was coolly examining the contents in the
      firelight. Jake and the two girls stood looking on. Laramore stared at the
      old man, but the latter did not seem at all abashed. Finally he closed the
      satchel and put it on the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a few minutes Mrs. King came in. She blew out the candle, and as she
      crossed to the mantelpiece she carefully extinguished the smoking wick.
      The change in her was more noticeable to her son than it had been a few
      minutes before. She looked very frail and white in her faded black cotton
      gown. Her shoes were worn and her bare feet showed through the holes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mary,&rdquo; she asked, &ldquo;have you put on the supper?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&rsquo;m; but it hain&rsquo;t tuk up yit.&rdquo; The girl went into the next room, which
      was used for kitchen and dining-room in one, and her mother followed her.
      In a few minutes the old woman came to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Walk out, all of you,&rdquo; she said, wearily. &ldquo;Luke, you &rsquo;ll have to put up
      with what is set before you; hog-meat is mighty sca&rsquo;ce this yeer. Just at
      fattenin&rsquo; time our hogs tuk the cholera an&rsquo; six was found dead in one day.
      Meat is fetchin&rsquo; fifteen cents a pound in town.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <h3>
      II
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>fter supper
      Laramore left his mother and sisters removing the dishes from the table
      and went out. He did not want to be left alone with his stepfather.
    </p>
    <p>
      He crossed the little brook that ran behind the cabin, and leaned against
      the rail fence which surrounded the pine-pole corn-crib. He could easily
      leave them in their poverty and ignorance, and return to the great
      intellectual world from which he had come&mdash;the world which understood
      and honored him; but, after all, could he do it now that he had seen his
      mother?
    </p>
    <p>
      The cabin door shone out a square of red light against the blackness of
      the hill and the silent pines beyond. He heard Jake whistling a tune he
      had whistled long ago when they had worked in the fields together, and the
      creaking of the puncheon floor as the family moved about within.
    </p>
    <p>
      A figure appeared in the door. It was his mother, and she was coming out
      to search for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here I am, mother,&rdquo; he said, as she advanced through the darkness; &ldquo;look
      out and don&rsquo;t get your feet wet!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She chuckled childishly as she stepped across the brook on the stones.
      When she reached him she put her hand on his arm and laughed: &ldquo;La, me,
      boy, a little wet won&rsquo;t hurt me&mdash;I&rsquo;m used to it; I&rsquo;ve milked the cows
      in that thar lot when the mire was shoe-mouth deep. I &lsquo;lowed I&rsquo;d find you
      heer some&rsquo;rs. You used to be a mighty hand to sneak off from the rest, an&rsquo;
      you hain&rsquo;t got over it. But you have changed. You don&rsquo;t talk our way
      exactly, an&rsquo; I reckon that&rsquo;s what aggravates Sam. He was goin&rsquo; on jest now
      about yore bein&rsquo; stuck up in yore talk an&rsquo; eatin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked past her at the full moon which was rising above the trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; said he, abruptly, and he put his arm around her neck, and his
      eyes filled&mdash;&ldquo;mother, I don&rsquo;t see how I can stay here long. Your
      health is bad and you are not comfortable; the others are strong and can
      stand it, but you can&rsquo;t. Come away with me, for a while anyway. I &rsquo;ll put
      you under a doctor and make you comfortable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked up into his eyes steadily for a moment, then she slapped him
      playfully on the breast and drew away from him. &ldquo;How foolish you talk!&rdquo;
       she laughed; &ldquo;why, you know I couldn&rsquo;t leave Sam an&rsquo; the children. He&rsquo;d go
      stark crazy &lsquo;thout me round, an&rsquo; they&rsquo;d be &lsquo;thout advice an&rsquo; counsel. La,
      me! What makes you think I ain&rsquo;t comfortable? This house is a sight better
      &rsquo;n the last one we had, an&rsquo; dryer, an&rsquo; a heap warmer inside. Hard times is
      likely to come anywhar an&rsquo; any time. It strikes rich an&rsquo; pore alike.
      Thar&rsquo;s &lsquo;Squire Loften offerin&rsquo; his big river-bottom plantation an&rsquo; the
      best new house in the county at a awful sacrifice, kase he is obliged to
      raise money to pay out &rsquo;n debt. He offers it fer ten thousand dollars, an&rsquo;
      it&rsquo;s wuth every dollar of twenty. Now, ef we-all jest had sech a place as
      that we&rsquo;d ax nobody any odds. Sam an&rsquo; Jake are hard workers, but they&rsquo;ve
      had &rsquo;nough bad luck to dishearten anybody.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ten thousand dollars!&rdquo; Laramore&rsquo;s heart bounded suddenly. It was exactly
      the amount he had in a Boston bank&mdash;all that he had ever been able to
      save. He had calculated on investing it with some literary friends in a
      magazine of which he was to be the editor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think they could manage the place successfully, mother?&rdquo; he asked,
      after a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you know they could,&rdquo; she returned. &ldquo;A body could make a livin&rsquo; on
      that land and never half try. &lsquo;Squire Loften spent his money like water,
      an&rsquo; let a gang o&rsquo; triflin&rsquo; darkies eat &rsquo;im up alive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remember the farm and the old house very well,&rdquo; he said, reflectively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They turned that into a barn,&rdquo; she ran on, enthusiastically. &ldquo;The new
      house is jest splendid&mdash;green blinds to the winders, an&rsquo; cyarpets on
      the floors, a spring-house, an&rsquo; a windmill to keep the house an&rsquo; barn in
      water.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;d better go in,&rdquo; he said, abruptly; &ldquo;you &rsquo;ll catch cold out here in
      the dew.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She laughed childishly as she walked back to the cabin by his side. A
      thick smoke and an unpleasant odor met them at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Sam a-burnin&rsquo; rags to oust the mosquitoes, so he kin sleep,&rdquo; she
      explained; &ldquo;they are wuss this yeer&rsquo;an I ever seed &lsquo;em. Jake an&rsquo; the gals
      grease the&rsquo;r faces with lamp-oil when they have any, but I jest kiver up
      my head with a rag an&rsquo; never know they are about. I reckon we&rsquo;d better go
      to bed. Jake has fixed him a bed up in the loft, so you kin sleep by
      yorese&rsquo;f. He&rsquo;s been jowerin? at his paw ever sence supper fer treatin&rsquo; you
      so bad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The next morning, after breakfast, Jake threw a bag of shelled corn on the
      bare back of his old bay mare and started to mill down the valley, and his
      father shouldered an ax and went up on the hill to cut wood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whar are you gwine?&rdquo; asked Mrs. King, following Laramore to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought I would walk over to the Loften place and see the improvements.
      I used to hunt over that land.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, be shore to git back by dinner, whatever you do. Me an&rsquo; Jane caught
      a hen on the roost last night, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;m gwine to make you a chicken pie,
      kase you used to love &rsquo;em so much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Half a mile up the road, which ran along the side of the hill, he came
      into view of the rich, level lands of the Loften plantation. He stood in
      the shade of a tall poplar and looked thoughtfully at the lush green
      meadows, the well-tilled fields of corn, cotton, and sorghum, and the
      large two-storied house with its dormer windows, tall, fluted columns, and
      broad verandas&mdash;at the numerous outhouses, barns, and stables, and
      the white-graveled drives and walks from the house to the road. Then he
      turned and looked back at the cabin&mdash;the home of his mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was hardly discernible in the gray morning mist that hung over the
      little vale in which it stood. He saw Jake, far away, riding along, in and
      out among the sassafras and sumac bushes that bordered a worn-out
      wheat-field, his long legs dangling at the sides of the mare. There was a
      bent figure in the wood-yard picking up chips; it was his mother or one of
      the girls.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor souls!&rdquo; he exclaimed; &ldquo;they have been in a dreary treadmill all
      their lives, and have never known the joy of one gratified ambition. If
      only I could conquer my own selfish desires I could give them comforts
      they never dreamed of possessing&mdash;a taste of happiness. It would take
      my last dollar, and Chamberlain and Gilraith would never understand. They
      would look elsewhere for capital and for an editor, and it would be like
      them to say they could get along without my contributions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was dusk when he returned to the cabin. Jake sat on his bag of meal in
      the door. Old Sam had taken off his shoes, and sat out under a persimmon
      tree &ldquo;coolin&rsquo; off,&rdquo; and yelling angrily at his wife to &ldquo;hurry up supper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When she heard that Laramore had returned she came to the door. &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t
      know what had become of you,&rdquo; she said, as she emerged from the cabin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I got interested in the Loften farm, and before I realized it the sun was
      down; I am sorry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it don&rsquo;t matter; I saved yore piece o&rsquo; pie, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;m just warmin&rsquo; it
      over. I bet you didn&rsquo;t get a single bite o&rsquo; dinner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I did; but I am ready for supper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As they were rising from the table Laramore said: &ldquo;I have got something to
      say to you all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They dragged their chairs back to the front room and sat down with awkward
      ceremony. They stared at him in open-mouthed wonder as he placed his chair
      in front of them. Old Sam seemed embarrassed by the formality of the
      proceedings, and endeavored to relieve himself by assuming indifference.
      He coughed conspicuously and hitched his chair back till it leaned against
      the door-jamb.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a tremor in Laramore&rsquo;s voice, and all the time he was speaking
      he did not look up from the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since I went away from you,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;I have studied hard and applied
      myself to a profession, and though I have wandered about a good deal I
      have managed to save a little money. I am not rich, but I am worth more
      than you think I am. You have never had any luck, and you have worked
      hard, and deserve more than has fallen to your lot. You never could make
      anything on this poor land. The Loften property is worth twice what he
      asked for it. I happened to have the money to spare and bought it. I have
      the deed for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a profound silence in the room. The occupants of the row of
      chairs stared at him with widened eyes, mute and motionless. A sudden
      breeze came in at the door and turned the flame of the candle on the
      mantel toward the wall, and caused black ropes of smoke from the
      pine-knots in the chimney to curl out into the room like pyrotechnic
      snakes. Mrs. King bent forward and looked into Lara-more&rsquo;s face and smiled
      and winked, then she glanced at the serious faces of the others and broke
      out into a childish laugh of genuine merriment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;La, me! Ef you-uns ain&rsquo;t settin&rsquo; thar and swallowin&rsquo; down every word that
      boy says jest ez ef it was so much law and gospel!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But none of them entered into her mood; indeed, they gave her not so much
      as a glance. Without replying, Laramore arose and took the candle from the
      mantelpiece. He stood it on the table and laid a folded paper beside it.
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s the deed,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It is made out to my mother to hold as long
      as she lives, and to fall eventually to her daughters and her son Jake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He left the paper on the table and went back to his chair. An awkward
      silence ensued. It was broken by old Sam. He coughed and threw his
      tobacco-quid out at the door, and smiling to hide his agitation he went to
      the table. His back was to them, and his face went out of view when he
      bent to hold the paper in the light.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what it is, by Jacks!&rdquo; he blurted out. &ldquo;Thar&rsquo;s no shenanigan about
      it. The Loften place is Mariar Habersham King&rsquo;s ef I kin read writin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a great clatter of shoes and chairs they rose and gathered around
      him, leaving their benefactor submerged in their shadow. Each took the
      paper and examined it silently, and then they slowly dispersed, leaving
      the document on the table. Sam King started aimlessly toward the kitchen,
      but finally turned to the front door, where he stood irresolute, staring
      out at the road. Mrs. King looked at Laramore helplessly and went out into
      the kitchen, and exchanging glances, the two girls followed her. Jake
      noticed that the wind was blowing the paper from the table, and he rescued
      it and silently offered it to his half-brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      Laramore motioned it from him. &ldquo;Give it to mother,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;She &rsquo;ll take
      care of it. By the way, Loften will get out at once. The price paid
      includes the crops, and they are in very good condition.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had Jake&rsquo;s bed to himself again that night. For hours he lay awake
      listening to the drone of excited conversation from the family which had
      gathered under the trees in front of the cabin. About eleven o&rsquo;clock some
      one came softly into his room. The moon had risen and its beams fell in at
      the open door. It was his mother, and she was moving toward his bed with
      cat-like caution. &ldquo;Is that you, mother?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      For an instant she was so much startled at finding him awake that she
      could not reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I tried not to wake you,&rdquo; she stammered. &ldquo;I just wanted to make shore
      yore bed was comfortable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is all right. I wasn&rsquo;t asleep, anyway.&rdquo; He could feel her trembling as
      she sat down on the edge of his bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seems like you couldn&rsquo;t sleep, nuther,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Thar hain&rsquo;t a shut eye
      in this cabin. They&rsquo;ve all laid down, an&rsquo; laid down an&rsquo; got up ergin, over
      an&rsquo; over.&rdquo; She laughed softly and twisted her hands nervously in her lap.
      &ldquo;We are all that excited we don&rsquo;t know which way to turn. Why, Luke, it
      &rsquo;ll be the talk o&rsquo; the county! Sech luck hain&rsquo;t fell to any family as pore
      as we are sence I can remember. La, me! It &rsquo;ud make you split yore sides
      a-laughin&rsquo; jest to set out thar an&rsquo; listen to all the plans they are
      makin&rsquo;. But Sam has the least of all to say; an&rsquo;, Luke, I&rsquo;m sorter sorry
      fer &lsquo;im. He feels bad about the way he has al&rsquo;ays treated you. He&rsquo;s too
      back&rsquo;ard an&rsquo; shamefaced to ax yore pardon, an&rsquo; he begged me jest now to do
      it fer &rsquo;im the fust time I got a chance. He&rsquo;s a good man, Luke, but he&rsquo;s
      gittin&rsquo; old, an&rsquo; has been hounded to death by debt an&rsquo; ill-luck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it; he is all right,&rdquo; replied Lara-more, tremulously. &ldquo;Tell him I
      have not the slightest ill-will against him, and that I hope he will get
      along better now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You talk like you don&rsquo;t intend to stay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I shall have to return North pretty soon&mdash;that is, after I see
      you moved into your new home. I can do better up there; you know I was not
      cut out for a farmer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon you know best &rsquo;bout your own arrangements, but I hate to have
      you go ag&rsquo;in. I&rsquo;d like to have all my children with me ef I could.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I &rsquo;ll come back every now and then; I won&rsquo;t stay away so long next time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She went out to tell her husband what he had said and to let her son
      sleep, but Laramore slept little. All night, at intervals, the buzz of low
      voices and sudden outbursts of merriment reached him.
    </p>
    <p>
      His mother stole softly into his room. This time it was to bring a shawl,
      which she cautiously spread over him, for the air had grown cold. She
      thought him asleep, but as she was turning away he caught her hand, and
      drew her down and kissed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Luke!&rdquo; she exclaimed; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t be foolish. Why, what&rsquo;s got in&mdash;?&rdquo;
       But her voice had grown husky and her words died away in an irrepressible
      sob of happiness. She did not stir for an instant; then impulsively she
      put her arms around his neck and kissed him. And he felt that her face was
      damp.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &lsquo;AS-IS&rsquo;, WITH NO

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation&rsquo;s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state&rsquo;s laws.

The Foundation&rsquo;s principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
